/*
 * TWO TAPS ARE ONE ORDER, AND THE DATABASE IS WHAT DECIDES IT.
 *
 * Owner, from a live floor: "when order comes from mobile app (captain app),
 * app gave for table number 5. when i click table number 5 i saw two orders.
 * its duplicate. when cancel both gone. werd... basically two orders in single
 * table not possible."
 *
 * createOnlineOrder already looked for an order with the same key before
 * writing one. That check is a read followed by a write, and two copies of the
 * same order arriving together both read "nothing there" and both insert. A
 * lookup cannot close that window; only a unique index can.
 *
 * The index has a second job that matters more than the race. Once it exists,
 * a resend is refused by the database rather than quietly written, so the
 * handset gets the order that already exists instead of a second ticket, even
 * if the lookup above were removed tomorrow.
 *
 * Against a real MongoDB, because this is entirely about what the server
 * enforces. A fake collection would accept both writes and the test would
 * prove nothing at all.
