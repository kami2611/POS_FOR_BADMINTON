/*
 * Removing the demo data for good.
 *
 * The switch hides and is reversible. This destroys, so the whole value of it
 * is in what it DECLINES to touch, and that is what these tests are about.
 *
 * A demo item exists to be rung up - that is how somebody finds out whether
 * the till suits them - and a sale line stores item_id. Delete the item and
 * the sale becomes a purchase of a product that does not exist. The sale is
 * real even though the product was not, so nothing puts that right afterwards.
 *
 * And a sample whose price a shop has changed is not a sample any more. By the
 * time they press this button that row is theirs, whatever tag it carries.
