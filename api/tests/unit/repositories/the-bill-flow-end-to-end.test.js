/*
 * THE WHOLE BILL FLOW, AGAINST A REAL DATABASE.
 *
 * Owner: "when app give print bill it was not working. have you tested its
 * working ? what was the issue before ?"
 *
 * The honest answers were no, and: I had added a `license` clause the query
 * that DRAWS THE FLOOR does not have. getTablesWithActiveOrders matches branch,
 * sale_process and payment_status and nothing else - so the table appeared, the
 * waiter tapped Print bill, and the answer was "Nothing is open on that table"
 * about an order they were looking at.
 *
 * It is not a boundary being dropped. Each shop has its own DATABASE; the
 * connection is the tenancy boundary, which is why the floor query has never
 * needed a licence clause and why the two are safe to agree.
 *
 * WHY THE OLD TESTS PASSED. They used a fake model, so nothing was ever
 * matched against anything - the query object was inspected, not run. These
 * use mongodb-memory-server and walk all three steps in order, because the
 * second half of this bug only appeared once the first was fixed: the request
 * started working and the till still saw nothing.
