/*
 * THE BILL, ASKED FOR FROM THE FLOOR.
 *
 * Owner: "can we add option from mobile take bill from mobile. is it
 * international standard or not ? ... also i was think settlement from mobile
 * app but usually cashier / desktop person only responsible and confirm the
 * settlement not waiter i thought."
 *
 * His reading is the standard one, and it is the rule this file exists to
 * hold: A WAITER MAY ASK FOR THE BILL AND MAY NOT SAY IT WAS PAID. The person
 * who takes the order must not be the person who declares the money received,
 * or a cash bill can be closed and pocketed with nothing in the system to
 * disagree. Toast, Square, Lightspeed, MICROS and Petpooja all let the floor
 * fire the bill; none of them let the floor settle it on the waiter's word.
 *
 * So most of what is tested here is what this path REFUSES to do.
