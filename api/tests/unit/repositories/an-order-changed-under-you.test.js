/*
 * TWO PHONES, ONE ORDER, AND A DISH THAT VANISHES.
 *
 * A handset sends the WHOLE order when it saves, and the till keeps only what
 * arrives. That is not a mistake: it is how a cancelled dish gets cancelled.
 *
 * It is also why a floor with several handsets loses food. Waiter A adds a
 * biryani at 19:00. Waiter B saves at 19:01 from a screen opened at 18:58, so
 * B's list has no biryani in it, and the till removes one the kitchen has
 * already cooked. The bill goes out short and nobody is told - not A, not B,
 * not the kitchen, not the shop.
 *
 * So a caller may say which version of the order it was looking at, and a save
 * written against an older one is refused. The client reloads and decides
 * again, because only a person knows whether that biryani was meant to go.
 *
 * A caller that says nothing is treated exactly as before. Handsets in the
 * wild are older than this code, and refusing their saves would turn a
 * data-loss bug into an outage.
