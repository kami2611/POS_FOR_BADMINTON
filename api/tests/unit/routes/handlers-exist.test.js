 *
 * If that method does not exist, `bindController` does not throw. It returns a
 * stub answering 501 "Handler not implemented", so the route mounts, the app
 * boots, every test passes, and the endpoint is dead.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. `/api/items/search` - the cashier's search box, the
 * first thing anybody does at a till - has been answering 501 in production,
 * and the access logs show real users hitting it. Nothing reported it, because
 * from the outside a 501 is a perfectly well-formed response and from the
 * inside there is no error at all.
 *
 * The failure is silent by construction, so a static check is the only thing
 * that finds it before a customer does.

 * start guarding against the NEXT one, instead of being disabled for being
 * noisy.
 *
