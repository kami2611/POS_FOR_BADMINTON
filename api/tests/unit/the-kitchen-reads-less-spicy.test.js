 * "less spicy" reaches the kitchen.
 *
 * Owner, holding a ticket: "when item print, item notes not printed. example
 * 'less spicy' not printed in the kot. its bad very bad".
 *
 * He is right that it is bad, and worse than it looks. The note is the one line
 * on a ticket the kitchen cannot work out for itself - everything else is the
 * dish, the table and the quantity, all of which the cook could reconstruct. A
 * customer who asks for something, is told yes, and does not get it blames the
 * restaurant, and the restaurant has no way of knowing it happened.
 *
 * WHERE IT WAS LOST, and it is not where anybody would look first.
 *
 * The note WAS stored correctly. `_priceOnlineLine` puts it on the sale item as
 * `item_description`, and both ticket builders print it - escpos-kot.js renders
 * `** less spicy **` under the dish when the field is there.
 *
 * But the kitchen ticket is not printed from `sale.items`. The poller builds
 * its print jobs out of `changes[].items` - the record of what changed - and
 * THAT list carried seven fields: id, name, quantity, process, code, unit,
 * price and total. No note. Three places built it, and all three dropped it.
 *
 * So every layer was working and the ticket was still wrong, which is why
 * reading the printing code found nothing.
