 * "Sign in as user" must actually sign the officer in.
 *
 * This was reported as broken several times and each investigation found the
 * server side healthy: the endpoint returned 200, the token verified, and
 * /api/items answered with it. Every one of those checks passed while the
 * feature did not work, because none of them was the thing that was wrong.
 *
 * The frontend decides somebody is signed in from TWO things, and every real
 * sign-in path sets both (users.js around 606-752, lock-screen.js restore()):
 *
 *     localStorage.posnic_jwt_token = <jwt>
 *     document.cookie loginuser=yes
 *
 * The page this endpoint returns set only the first. So the browser arrived
 * holding a perfectly valid credential the app had decided not to use, and
 * redirected to login.html. Nothing errored anywhere.
 *
 * These assertions are deliberately about the page's CONTENT rather than the
 * status code, because the status code was never the problem.
