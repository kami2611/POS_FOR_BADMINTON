/*
 * Two shops in one process must not be able to see each other.
 *
 * This is the property the whole shard rests on, and the one whose failure is
 * silent: nothing throws, the query succeeds, and it returns the wrong
 * customer's sales. It is worth proving rather than reasoning about.
 *
 * Four things are checked, and each corresponds to a way it has gone wrong in
 * systems like this before:
 *
 *   - the database follows the request, not the process;
 *   - the secrets follow the request, so a token minted for one shop does not
 *     verify for another;
 *   - concurrent requests do not bleed into each other across awaits, which is
 *     the failure a plain module-level variable would have;
 *   - code that escapes the request scope fails loudly instead of silently
 *     picking whichever shop the process last touched.
