 * connected to at startup, which is correct for a till and is a cross-tenant
 * leak in a process serving several shops: no error, the query succeeds, and it
 * returns another shop's data.
 *
 * They were all routed through currentConnection(). This test is what keeps
 * them there. A guard like this is worth more than the original fix, because
 * the fix is a one-off and the rule has to survive everyone who adds a
 * controller afterwards - and the thing it prevents is invisible in review.
 *
 * If this fails, the message names the file and line. Use
