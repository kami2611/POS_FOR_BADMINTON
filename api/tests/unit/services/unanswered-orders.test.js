 * waiting-order-policy.js was written, tested and merged, and decided
 * perfectly for nobody. `setPolicy()` on the till was called from nowhere, so
 * the policy was always "nothing"; and when it did speak, the till emitted an
 * event NOTHING LISTENED TO and then dropped the order from its pending map -
 * so the alarm went quiet with the order still sitting there. A stopped alarm
 * is a promise that somebody dealt with it, and that promise was false.
 *
 * The tests below are in the order of the ways this can go wrong, worst first:
 * cancelling an order nobody asked to cancel, then failing to act at all.
