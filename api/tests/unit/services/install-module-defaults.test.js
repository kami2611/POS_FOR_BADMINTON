 *
 * WHY IT LOOKED LIKE EVERYTHING WAS ON. Nothing was ever switched on. The
 * client reads `settings[key] !== false`, so a key that was never saved reads
 * as enabled - and a brand-new shop had none of them saved. Ten features
 * appeared on because ten features were absent, which is not a decision
 * anybody made.
 *
 * The read rule is deliberately NOT changed: every shop already running relies
 * on absent-meaning-on, and flipping it would switch features off in all of
 * them on the next deploy, silently. So the values are written instead.
