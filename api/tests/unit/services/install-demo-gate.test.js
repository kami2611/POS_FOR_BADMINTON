 * Which words mean "give this shop demo data".
 *
 * THE BUG: Gateway's provisioner sends `register_demo: 'yes'` and
 * `business: 'retail'`. This service tested for `'on'` and read
 * `businessType`, so both missed - every cloud shop was created with no demo
 * data at all and, had it run, always the supermarket pack whatever the trade.
 *
 * It failed silently because each miss looks like a decision. No demo data
 * reads as a shop that asked for none; a supermarket pack reads as a default
 * somebody picked. What it meant in practice was a new customer opening their
 * till and finding one product in it.
 *
 * The normaliser is lifted out of install.service.js rather than copied, so
 * this cannot pass while the service drifts away from it.
