 * A shard that reads its shop list from a file instead of the control database.
 *
 * The demo estate needs this and production must not notice it.
 *
 * Reading the control registry means holding the control credential and
 * TENANT_SECRET_KEY - the key that unseals every shop's secrets across the
 * whole fleet. The demo box is a public machine whose logins are printed on its
 * own login page, and it serves fifty shops that contain nothing but sample
 * data. Putting the fleet master key there would be a poor trade.
 *
 * These are source pins rather than a running shard, because starting one
 * needs a mongod and a registry; what has to hold is that the new path is
 * OPTIONAL, that it keeps the isolation rules the control path has, and that
 * the control path is untouched when the variable is unset.
