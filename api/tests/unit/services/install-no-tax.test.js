/**
 * A shop in a country whose tax we do not know is created with NO tax.
 *
 * Owner's decision, after the audit found that 128 of the 246 countries in
 * countries.json carry exactly one tax row - {"tax_name":"0% Tax",
 * "tax_value":0} - and the installer inserted it. That is not a researched
 * "this country has no sales tax". It is missing data wearing the costume of
 * an answer, and it gave a shop in Angola a real tax record, a tax column on
 * its receipts, and the clear implication that Posnic knows the Angolan
 * regime. It does not.
 *
 * "Tax not configured for your country yet - switch it on in Settings when
 * you're ready" is honest. A fake 0% rate is not.
 *
 * These run against the REAL countries.json, because the thing being asserted
 * is that the data and the installer agree. A fixture would only prove that
 * two of my own inventions match.
