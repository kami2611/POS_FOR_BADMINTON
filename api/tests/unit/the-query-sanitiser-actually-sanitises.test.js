/*
 * The NoSQL guard on the query string, which had not been running.
 *
 * app.js mounts a sanitiser that walks `req.query` and `req.body` and drops
 * any key beginning with `$` - the operators that turn a filter into a
 * different question. It is the app's own, rather than express-mongo-sanitize,
 * and it is load bearing: filter-guard.js says so in its own opening line.
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG
 *
 * It did this:
 *
 *     req.query = sanitize({ ...req.query });
 *
 * On Express 5 - which this API runs - `query` is a GETTER that re-parses the
 * query string on every access. Assigning to it does nothing and throws
 * nothing. Mutating the object it returns does nothing either, because the
 * next read parses the string again.
 *
 * So from the day this app moved to Express 5, every `$`-prefixed query
 * parameter survived the one middleware that exists to remove it, the warning
 * it logs never fired, and nothing anywhere looked wrong. The body half was
 * never affected: `req.body` is an ordinary property.
 *
 * These tests run a REAL Express app, because the whole bug is a thing Express
 * does that no amount of reading the sanitiser would show.
