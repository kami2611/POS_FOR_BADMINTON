 * it meant: 1000 requests per address for every shop at once.
 *
 * It is not a theoretical failure. A load test across twenty shops returned
 * "Too many requests" from shops it had not reached yet - and the shop that got
 * the 429 has no way of knowing why, because the traffic that spent its
 * allowance belonged to somebody else.
 *
 * The opposite decision applies to sign-in, and that is also asserted here: a
