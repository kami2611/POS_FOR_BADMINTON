/*
 * Suites that are failing today and are not yet fixed.
 *
 * These are quarantined rather than deleted or silenced. The distinction
 * matters: CI still runs every other suite and still fails on any new
 * breakage, and this file is the list of what is owed - visible, countable and
 * in version control, rather than a green tick that means nothing.
 *
 * Nothing else should be added here without a reason beside it. A quarantine
 * list that grows quietly is how a test suite stops being worth running.
 *
 * To see where they stand:  npm run test:known-failures
