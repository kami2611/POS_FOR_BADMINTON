/*
 * THE SHOP'S DECLARED DEFAULT, ACTUALLY FIRING.
 *
 * Owner: "let restaurent owner decide that. give option auto cancel or auto
 * accept. based ont time he defines it. by default dont accpept or reject."
 *
 * WHAT WAS THERE, AND WHY IT WAS WORSE THAN NOTHING
 *
 * waiting-order-policy.js was written, tested and merged. It decides perfectly.
 * Nothing ever asked it for a decision it could act on:
 *
 *   - `setPolicy()` on the desktop OrderAlert was called from nowhere, so the
 *     policy was always `{ onSilence: 'nothing', decideAfterMinutes: 0 }` and
 *     `decide` could only ever answer "nothing";
 *   - and when it did answer, the till emitted `posnic:order-decided` on the
 *     process bus, WHICH NOTHING LISTENED TO - and then deleted the order from
 *     its pending map, so the alarm went quiet with the order still sitting
 *     there unanswered.
 *
 * An alarm that stops is a promise that somebody dealt with it. That is the
 * one failure this whole area exists to prevent, and it was built in.
 *
 * WHY THE DECISION LIVES HERE AND NOT IN THE TILL
 *
 * The till is a sound module. Its own comment says so: "deciding an order is
 * somebody else's job and belongs where the order lives. A sound module that
 * could cancel a customer's order would be a surprising place to find that
 * power." It is also the wrong half: a shop served from the cloud has no
 * desktop till at all, and its orders would never be decided.
 *
 * So the two halves read the same pure policy for different fields. The till
 * reads `alert` and `reach` and makes a noise. This reads `decide` and moves
 * the order, through the same `decideOnOrder` a person at the queue uses - so
 * an automatic acceptance prints its kitchen ticket exactly the way a tapped
 * one does, rather than by a second path that could drift from it.
 *
 * NOTHING HAPPENS UNLESS A SHOP ASKED FOR IT. Absent settings mean a policy of
 * `nothing`, and that is the default this ships with. A product that cancels a
 * customer's order because a shop never opened a settings page has made a
 * decision that was not its to make.
