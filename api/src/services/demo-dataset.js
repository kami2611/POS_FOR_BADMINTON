/*
 * Demo data from the website's dataset library.
 *
 * Owner: "if you look for web-frontend you can see dataset folder.
 * posnic.com/dataset/INR/auto_parts.zip - inside all demo data will be there
 * with images. so every currency will have its own data... this functionality
 * is common for both from website and as well from app installing demo data
 * also features demo data toggle."
 *
 * The zips are the richer source: thirty products per trade with real
 * pricing (price, MRP, cost), tax profiles, opening stock, and a photograph
 * per product - against the built-in packs' name+price+stock. One zip per
 * currency per trade, so an INR shop and a USD shop each see prices that
 * make sense where they trade.
 *
 * THE RULE THAT SHAPES EVERYTHING HERE: the website is OPTIONAL. Provisioning
 * a shop must never wait on posnic.com being up, slow, or reachable - a shop
 * that cannot be created because a marketing site hiccuped is an outage
 * nobody would think to connect to its cause. Every failure in this file -
 * timeout, size cap, bad zip, missing manifest - resolves to null, and the
 * caller falls back to the built-in packs that have always shipped.
 *
 * IMAGES are extracted into the API's own /uploads/demo/<datasetId>/, which
 * is served with CORS and - unlike the frontend tree - is not rsync --delete
 * territory, so a deploy cannot orphan every demo photograph (the CSP already
 * expects product images on same-origin /uploads). On a multi-tenant box the
 * app directory is shared, so the extract is per-DATASET, written once and
 * reused by every shop that installs that trade; the purge never deletes the
 * files, because another tenant may be pointing at them.
