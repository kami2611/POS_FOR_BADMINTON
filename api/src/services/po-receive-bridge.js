/*
 * The ONE bridge between purchase orders and receipts
 * (PO_LIFECYCLE_DESIGN.md step 2).
 *
 * Direction matters: receivings are the source of truth and the PO is the
 * mirror. This module READS receivings and WRITES purchase_orders - never
 * the other way, and never stock. qty_received is recomputed from scratch
 * from every receiving linked by source_po_id, so calling this twice, ten
 * times, or after a sync replay always lands on the same numbers - the
 * idempotence the sync rules demand. A blind += would double-count on the
 * first replay.
