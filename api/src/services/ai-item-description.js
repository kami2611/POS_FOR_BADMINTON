 * Writing the description a shopkeeper was never going to write.

 * The description field is optional, and in practice it is empty on most
 * items in most shops, because typing two sentences about a bar of soap is
 * the least rewarding minute of anybody's day. It stops being optional the
 * moment a shop turns on online ordering, where an item with no description
 * is a dish nobody orders.
 *
 * WHAT IT MAY AND MAY NOT SAY.
 *
 * It may describe what the shop already told us: the name, what it is a kind
 * of, who supplies it, how it is sold, whether it is vegetarian. It may not
 * invent anything else. "Organic", "handmade", "sugar free" and "best in the
 * city" are claims, some of them regulated, and a shopkeeper who publishes
 * one because software suggested it is the one carrying the consequence. So
 * the instruction is explicit about it, and the output is a draft in a form
 * field that a person edits and saves, never a write.
 *
 * The shop's own language, not English, unless the shop is English. A kirana
 * in Coimbatore with a Tamil storefront does not want English copy, and
 * translating it afterwards is a second job nobody will do.
