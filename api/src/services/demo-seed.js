/*
 * Sample sales and quotes, so a demo shop looks like a shop.
 *
 * Owner ask: "Demo data filled. few sample sales, sample quote, all sample
 * include with demo data module."
 *
 * A catalogue on its own demonstrates nothing. Every report opens empty, the
 * dashboard shows zero, the quote list says there is nothing here - so the
 * parts of the product somebody is deciding about are exactly the parts they
 * cannot see. A handful of sales fixes that.
 *
 * THE OBJECTION, AND WHY IT IS ANSWERED RATHER THAN IGNORED
 *
 * Fake money in a real shop's reports is a genuine cost: for the first week
 * every figure the owner reads is wrong, and they have no way to know which
 * part is theirs. That is why:
 *
 *   - every row is tagged `demo_pack`, so it can be found and removed exactly,
 *   - the sales are DATED IN THE PAST, over the WEEK before the shop was
 *     created (owner: "demo history date should be last one week"), so
 *     today's takings - the number anybody actually watches - are the shop's
 *     own from the first sale they ring up,
 *   - the amounts are small and ordinary, not round showroom numbers,
 *   - and removing demo data removes these too.
 *
 * WHAT IT WILL NOT DO
 *
 * It will not invent stock movements or touch item quantities. A demo sale
 * that decremented stock would leave a shop whose counts are wrong before they
 * have sold anything, and stock is the one number a shopkeeper checks against
 * the shelf.
