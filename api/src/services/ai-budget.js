/*
 * What this shop has spent on AI this month, and whether it may spend more.
 *
 * Sits beside ai.service.js, which enforces it. That file is the one place a
 * model call goes through, so a cap checked there is a cap every feature has
 * without any of them remembering to ask.
 *
 * WHOSE MONEY THIS IS.
 *
 * The shop's own. Posnic charges nothing for AI and the key belongs to the
 * shopkeeper, so nothing here protects our margin - there is no margin in it.
 * It protects the customer from us. A loop that calls a model in a retry
 * bills more in a day than the shop pays for the software in a year, and the
 * invoice arrives on their card with our name on the software that spent it.
 *
 * That makes two things non-negotiable. The cap is checked BEFORE the call,
 * because a cap checked afterwards is a report. And the meter is visible,
 * because somebody spending their own money is entitled to watch it.
 *
 * The figures here are OURS, not the provider's. They are computed from the
 * token counts each call reports, at published list prices, so they will not
 * match the invoice to the paisa - promotional rates, batch discounts and
 * cache reads all move it. They are close enough to answer "is this costing
 * me anything" and to stop a runaway, which is what they are for. The
 * provider's own dashboard is the authority on the bill, and the settings
 * screen should say so.
 *
 * A LIVE VOICE LINE is the one call that reports no token count: the audio
 * goes phone to provider and never passes here. So a second of open line is
 * priced below, and voice-meter.js turns the page's "still talking" ticks
 * into seconds, and the seconds into this meter and this cap. Without that,
 * the monthly limit covered every question typed and not a minute spoken,
 * which is the dearest thing the shop can switch on.
