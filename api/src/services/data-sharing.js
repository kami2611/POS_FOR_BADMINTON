/*
 * Whether one branch sees another branch's customers, suppliers and stock.
 *
 * The owner's framing, and it is the right one: "this should be visible based
 * on settings only". Not a migration, not a merge, not a script anybody has to
 * remember to run - a switch, and the reads follow it.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS RESOLVED AT READ TIME
 *
 * The obvious alternative is to write the sharing into the rows: turn it on,
 * grant every existing customer to every branch, done. That is wrong in three
 * ways. It is a mass write over live data. It cannot be undone - once the
 * grants are in the rows, turning sharing OFF means guessing which grants were
 * blanket and which were deliberate. And it leaves every customer created
 * afterwards needing the same treatment, so "why doesn't the new branch see
 * this customer" comes back forever.
 *
 * Resolving at read time has none of that. Flip it on and the next query
 * shares; flip it off and the next query does not. Nothing is written, so
 * nothing has to be unwritten, and the deliberate per-customer grants that
 * `branch_access[]` exists for keep working underneath either setting.
 *
 * WHAT "SHARED" MEANS FOR A QUERY
 *
 * It means the branch clause is dropped, and nothing else. Every one of these
 * queries already carries `license`, and a shop's data lives in its own
 * database (db/tenant-connections.js), so dropping the branch clause widens a
 * read to the ACCOUNT and can reach no further. That is the whole mechanism -
 * see scopeBranch below, which returns null and lets the existing
 * `if (!branchId) return query` in branch-scope.js do the work.
 *
 * WHY THE STORED DEFAULT IS OFF WHILE THE FORM DEFAULT IS ON
 *
 * The owner asked for these "auto selected as true based on standard values",
 * and the branch-creation form does exactly that - the boxes arrive ticked.
 * But an ABSENT setting on an existing account must resolve to off, because
 * the alternative is that a deploy silently shows one shop another shop's
 * customer list. Sharing is a decision, and someone has to have made it; a
 * pre-ticked box on a form is a decision, an upgrade is not.

/*
 * This module exports the CLASS, not an instance.
 *
 * Calling resolveGroup on the class gives undefined, which throws, which the
 * catch below turns into "not shared" - so the switch would have been dead in
 * exactly the way that looks like a working narrow default. Written the wrong
 * way first here, and only caught because the mock in the tests had the shape
 * the real module does not. `_repo()` exists so a test can assert the wiring
 * without a mock standing in for it.

 *
 * Customers and suppliers default to shared: a person who walks into one shop
 * of a chain and then another is the same person, with the same balance and
 * the same loyalty, and two records for them is the bug.
 *
 * INVENTORY IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE. The owner asked for "inventory copy, or
 * common inventory", and for this schema those are not two settings - one is
 * workable and one would corrupt a till. Stock lives on the item document and
 * each branch owns its own items, so widening the item read the way these
 * widen the customer read would show a cashier N copies of every product, one
 * per branch, each with a different count; selling the wrong row decrements
 * another shop's stock. A real common inventory needs per-branch stock records,
 * which is a schema change, not a switch.
 *
 * What a new branch actually wants is the CATALOGUE with its own counts, and
 * that is services/catalogue-copy.js - offered on the same form, as a copy.
