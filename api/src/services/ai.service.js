/*
 * Asking a model something, using the shop's own account.
 *
 * This is the plumbing, not a feature. Nothing here decides anything about a
 * shop: it takes a question and some pictures, sends them to whichever
 * provider that shop configured, and hands back text. Every feature that wants
 * a model goes through here, so there is one place where the key lives, one
 * place that decides whether this shop has it switched on at all, and one
 * place that can be made to stop.
 *
 * WHY THE KEY IS HERE AND NOT IN A CLIENT. The same reason as
 * transcribe.service.js, which this is modelled on. A key in a page or a
 * handset is a key on every device that ever loads it, in a file anybody can
 * read; it cannot be rotated without reinstalling all of them, and a leak is
 * billed to the shop until somebody reads the invoice. So the key lives in the
 * shop's own settings and never leaves this module - not in a response, not in
 * an error, not in a log line.
 *
 * THREE RULES THIS MODULE ENFORCES, so no feature has to remember them.
 *
 * NEVER IN THE SALE PATH. A till sells when the internet is down; that is the
 * whole product. So nothing here may sit between a cashier and a completed
 * sale. Every caller must be a screen somebody chose to open, and every
 * failure must be survivable by doing the job the old way.
 *
 * NOTHING IS APPLIED WITHOUT A PERSON. A model is not deterministic: the same
 * question can answer differently twice, which is intolerable for anything
 * touching money or stock. So this returns TEXT for a human to look at, and
 * the writing is done by the same reviewed, tested code paths that a person
 * typing it in would use.
 *
 * OFF BY DEFAULT. A shop that has configured nothing gets nothing, silently
 * and correctly, and pays nobody.
 *
 * Adding a provider is one entry in PROVIDERS. Each is given the question and
 * the key and returns text plus what it cost; nothing else about the shape of the request
 * reaches the caller, so a feature can never come to depend on which provider
 * a shop happens to use.

     * one call rather than losing an answer they have already paid for.
