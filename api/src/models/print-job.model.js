 * A THING SOMEBODY WANTS PRINTED, AND WHICH MACHINE SHOULD PRINT IT.
 *
 * Owner: "there should be way to communicate the till via localhost or via
 * cloud. thats the whole point. make it happen. may be seperate collection for
 * print ? need solution that which till need to send for bill also there."
 *
 * WHY A COLLECTION AND NOT A FLAG ON THE SALE. The first version put
 * bill_requested_at on the sale itself, which works exactly as long as the
 * till and the sale live in the same database. On the shop's own Wi-Fi they
 * do. Pointed at the cloud they do not: the request is written to the cloud's
 * database and the till is looking at its own, so the paper never comes.
 *
 * A job carries everything the printer needs WITH IT. The till does not have
 * to own the sale, look it up, or wait for anything to sync down - it asks
 * "anything for me?", gets a document, and prints it. That one property is
 * what makes localhost and cloud the same code path instead of two.
 *
 * AND IT NAMES THE MACHINE. A shop with a counter till and a first-floor till
 * has two printers in two rooms; "print the bill" is not an instruction until
 * it says where. A job with no till named is for whoever gets to it first,
 * which is the right answer for the overwhelmingly common one-till shop.
 *
 * The claim is what stops two tills printing the same bill - see
 * claimPrintJobs, which moves a job to `printing` and hands it over in ONE
 * atomic update. A queue without that is a queue that duplicates under exactly
 * the conditions it exists for.
