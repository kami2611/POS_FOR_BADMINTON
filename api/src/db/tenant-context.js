 * Which shop the code currently running belongs to.
 *
 * Most of this API reaches the database through BaseModel, and BaseModel keeps
 * its handle in a static: `BaseModel.database`, set once when the process
 * connects. One process, one shop - which is exactly right for a till, and
 * exactly wrong for a process serving several shops, because every request
 * would read whichever database happened to be assigned at startup.
 *
 * That failure is silent. Nothing throws, the query succeeds, and it returns
 * another shop's sales and customers. It is the worst outcome this system has,
 * so the design here is built around making it impossible rather than unlikely:
 *
 *   - the handle is carried in AsyncLocalStorage, so it follows the request
 *     through awaits without being passed down through twelve controllers and
 *     twelve repositories;
 *   - when multi-tenant mode is on and a piece of code runs with no shop in
 *     context, it THROWS. It does not fall back to a default. A fallback is
 *     the leak: it would quietly serve one shop's data to another and look
 *     like it worked;
 *   - standalone - a till, a self-hosted server - never turns the mode on, and
 *     nothing about its behaviour changes.
 *
 * The asymmetry is deliberate. In standalone the absence of a context is
 * normal; in multi-tenant it means a code path escaped the request scope, and
 * the only safe response is to stop.

 * to decides which database auth reads its users from - so it cannot depend on
 * auth having happened. They also fail differently: an absent request context
 * means nobody is signed in, which is ordinary; an absent tenant context in
 * multi-tenant mode means a code path escaped its request, which is not.

 *
 * JWT_SECRET, ENCRYPTION_KEY and the rest are per shop. Today that works
 * because each shop owns a process and its own environment, so

 * it becomes whichever shop started the process - which means a token minted
 * for one shop verifies in another, and a record encrypted for one shop is
 * decrypted with another's key.
 *
 * That is worse than the database leak. A wrong database returns another
 * shop's data and can at least be noticed; a shared signing key means the
 * authentication boundary between two customers has quietly stopped existing,
 * and nothing about the failure is visible from inside either shop.
 *
 * So: the shop's own value when there is one, and in multi-tenant mode an
 * error rather than the environment. Falling back to `process.env` there is
 * precisely the leak - it would return a value belonging to some other shop
 * while looking like it worked.
 *
 * Standalone is unchanged: no context, no multi-tenant, the environment is
 * correct and is used.
