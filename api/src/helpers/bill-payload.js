/*
 * A SALE, TURNED INTO SOMETHING A PRINTER CAN ACTUALLY PRINT.
 *
 * This exists because of a bug that printed perfectly blank paper.
 *
 * The till renders bills with src/escpos-receipt.js, and that takes a VIEW
 * MODEL - `{ storeName, items: [{ name, qty, amount }], total, ... }` - not a
 * sale document. On the counter's own screen the view model is scraped out of
 * the shop's rendered receipt template by frontend/.../receipt-data.js, which
 * is fine there because a browser is holding the template.
 *
 * Nothing is holding a template when a waiter asks for a bill from the floor.
 * The queued job was handing the raw Mongo document straight to the renderer,
 * whose field names are all different - `item_name` against `name`,
 * `sales_total` against `total` - so every lookup missed, and what came out of
 * the printer was a header, an empty item table and a total of 0.00. It looked
 * like a printer fault and it was not.
 *
 * Built HERE, on the server, at the moment the job is queued, for two reasons:
 *
 *   1. The shop's name, address and GSTIN live in the shop's database. A till
 *      paired to a cloud tenant does not have that database, so anything the
 *      till would have to look up is something it cannot look up.
 *   2. The job then carries everything. No sync, no second round trip, and a
 *      till that is handed a job can print it with the network already gone.
 *
 * This is the BILL - what a guest is asked to pay. The fiscal receipt is a
 * different document, printed at the counter when the table actually settles,
 * and it still goes through the shop's own template.

 * WHAT ELSE THE BILL PRINTS, and it is off unless the shop says otherwise.

 * customer's own GST number - and then said what to do with it: "we have those
 * as optional. no need to incluede... based on settings we can add it. like
 * toggle or desgn in one place for printing receipt."
 *
 * So each one is a switch, and ABSENT MEANS OFF. That direction matters: 90
 * shops are printing today, and a default of on would put new rows on every
 * one of their bills the morning this deploys, which is exactly the "new
 * issues" he asked printing not to bring. A shop that wants the hotel bill
 * turns them on and gets it; a shop that says nothing keeps the bill it has.
 *
 * The settings form posts strings, so a stored 'false' is a real value. Only
 * an explicit true, in either shape, counts as on.
