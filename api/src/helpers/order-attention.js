/*
 * Make a noise when an order arrives.
 *
 * WHY A SOUND AND NOT A BADGE.
 *
 * The person who needs to know is not looking at the screen. They are at the
 * pass, in the kitchen, serving a table, or - the owner's own words - watching
 * a movie. A number that goes up in the corner of a page nobody is facing is
 * not a notification, it is a record of something that was missed. Online
 * orders are the one part of this product where nobody is standing in front of
 * the till when the event happens.
 *
 * TWO SOUNDS, BECAUSE THEY MEAN DIFFERENT THINGS.
 *
 *   received   the order is accepted and the ticket is already printing. A
 *              short chime: this is information, not a task.
 *   waiting    the order is held and will sit there until somebody says yes.
 *              An alarm, and one worth repeating, because until it is answered
 *              the customer is waiting and the kitchen does not know they
 *              exist.
 *
 * Collapsing them into one sound would train staff to ignore the one that
 * matters, which is exactly how alarms stop working.
 *
 * `process` IS THE BUS, for the same reason kot-notify uses it: the API ships
 * outside the ASAR archive while the desktop code lives inside it, so the two
 * halves cannot reliably require the same module instance. A shared emitter
 * file would quietly become two emitters and the event would go nowhere. Both
 * halves already have `process`.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE MAY THROW. A sound card, a muted device or a missing listener
 * must never fail an order a customer has already placed.

 * answered, and an alarm still going is an alarm about nothing.
