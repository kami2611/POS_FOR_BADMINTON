/*
 * Support logging in as a shop's own user.
 *
 * "The totals are wrong on my sales report" cannot be answered from outside the
 * shop. The alternatives are worse than this: asking a shopkeeper for their
 * password, or keeping a support account in every tenant - a permanent extra
 * credential per shop, which is a larger standing risk than a link that lives
 * for a minute.
 *
 * The console mints a token signed with *this shop's* JWT_SECRET, which it can
 * already read from the control database because it seals those secrets in the
 * first place. That deliberately adds no new shared secret: anyone who could
 * forge one of these could already forge an ordinary login token, so this opens
 * no door that the secret itself does not already open.
 *
 * Four things make it narrow.
 *
 *   - It carries `uid`, never `id`. The auth middleware reads `decoded.id`, so
 *     this token cannot be presented as an ordinary credential; it can only be
 *     spent here, once, for the one thing it is for.
 *   - It is valid for a minute. Long enough to follow a link, too short to be
 *     worth keeping.
 *   - It is single use, enforced by a unique index rather than by a check -
 *     two simultaneous uses of the same link cannot both win a race against an
 *     index.
 *   - Every use is written to the shop's own records, marked as impersonation
 *     and naming the officer. A support action nobody can see afterwards is
 *     indistinguishable from an intrusion.
