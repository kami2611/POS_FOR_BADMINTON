/*
 * One endpoint per settings group (SETTINGS_AND_BRANCH_SCOPE_DESIGN, D2/S3).
 *
 * The whole point: an endpoint that only knows its own group cannot be asked
 * for a field that belongs to another one. The three bugs of 2026-08-20 were
 * all the same shape - a single endpoint serving both the full settings form
 * and small partial saves, demanding fields the caller never had:
 *
 *   - a non-empty notification_value on every call (5c84111)
 *   - one $set built from the whole form, wiping unsent keys (5c84111)
 *   - default_customer / default_supplier required to upload a signature
 *     image (69bc0cd)
 *
 * None of those can be expressed here.
 *
 * SECRETS ARE WRITE-ONLY. GET /settings/secrets answers which credentials are
 * configured, never their values. Today an SMTP password sits in the same
 * document as roundOff and is handed to any client that reads settings; this
 * is where that stops.
