 * Counters in the database, not in this process's memory.
 *
 * The default store is per process, which is correct while each shop has a
 * process of its own. As soon as shops share a pool of workers it silently
 * multiplies every limit by the number of workers - twenty sign-in attempts
 * becomes eighty across four - with the configuration still reading "limit: 20".
 * Each limiter gets its own prefix so their keys cannot collide.

/*
 * A tighter limit on the handful of routes that guess at credentials.
 *
 * The general limiter in app.js allows 1000 requests per fifteen minutes,
 * which is right for a till: one page load makes dozens of calls, and a shop
 * throttled mid-sale is a shop that cannot trade. But applied to a login form
 * that same allowance is a thousand password attempts per quarter hour from
 * one address, which is a workable brute-force window against any password a
 * shopkeeper actually chose.
 *
 * There was also a second limiter in middleware/security.js, never mounted,
 * whose `skip` list named `/auth/login` and `/auth/refresh-token` - exempting
 * the two routes that most need limiting. Written, presumably, meaning "these
 * are special"; the effect was the opposite of the intent. It is deleted
 * rather than fixed, because two limiters and one of them dead is how the
 * next person concludes rate limiting is handled when it is not.
 *
 * The numbers here are chosen against a shop, not a security benchmark:
 * somebody who has genuinely forgotten which of two passwords they used gets
 * plenty of attempts, and a script gets a few seconds of work per guess.
