/*
 * A permanent record of who changed what, from where.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS.
 *
 * A shop could not sign in. Their password had been changed the previous
 * afternoon, and the ONLY trace of it anywhere was a timestamp on the user
 * document. Not who did it, not from what address, not whether it was the
 * owner themselves at the counter or somebody who had the password. We could
 * tell the shop that their password had changed and nothing more than that,
 * which is close to useless to somebody deciding whether they have been
 * broken into.
 *
 * `data_change_log` already records edits, but models write it and models have
 * never seen a request, so it carries no address and no user agent. This is
 * the security-relevant half: the small number of events where "from where"
 * is the whole question.
 *
 * WHAT IS NEVER WRITTEN HERE: passwords, password hashes, PINs, tokens or API
 * keys, in either the old or the new value. An audit log is read by more
 * people than the thing it audits, and a log that leaks a credential is worse
 * than no log. `redactValue` enforces that rather than trusting callers.
