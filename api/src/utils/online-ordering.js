/*
 * Whether this shop is taking orders on its online channel right now.
 *
 * ONE PLACE, BECAUSE THERE ARE FOUR ANSWERS AND THEY COMPOSE.
 *
 * A shop can be shut to a customer for four unrelated reasons: the channel is
 * a menu and never took orders; someone paused it ten minutes ago; it is
 * outside opening hours; or the module is off entirely. The customer's page
 * has to render a different sentence for each, and the order endpoint has to
 * refuse for each. Two implementations of that would drift, and the one that
 * drifts is the one that matters - the server's - because hiding the cart is a
 * courtesy and refusing the order is the control.
 *
 * `POST /online-ordering/:storeId/orders` is anonymous by design (a customer has no
 * credentials) and reachable from the internet. Anybody can skip our page and
 * post an order directly. So the page asks this module what to draw, and the
 * endpoint asks this module whether to accept, and neither gets a vote.
 *
 * WHY THE PURE FUNCTIONS TAKE A DAY AND A MINUTE COUNT.
 *
 * The schedule arithmetic is where this kind of feature goes wrong, so it is
 * separated from the clock: `isOpenAt` and `nextOpeningFrom` take a weekday
 * index and minutes past midnight and know nothing about timezones or Date.
 * They can be tested exhaustively without a database, a network or a fake
 * clock. Only `channelState` touches moment-timezone, and only to answer "what
 * day and minute is it where this branch is".
 *
 * NO SERVICE OR MODEL IMPORTS. Requiring this file must never open a database
 * connection, for the same reason the kiosk key guard has that rule.

 * bakery that also delivers with nowhere to stand. The real difference between
 * a restaurant and a clothes shop is not the software, it is which of these
 * they offer. A restaurant turns on dine in and takeaway; a clothes shop turns
 * on pickup and delivery; a bakery does three of the four. The vertical stops

 * for dine in, an address for delivery - which is a form, not an architecture.

 * the item form learned to take a set. The first version of this mapped it with
 * `String(src)`, which turns an object into the literal text
 * "[object Object]"; the cover came through fine because that one IS a string,
 * so a dish showed its first photo and a broken icon for every other. Exactly
 * what the owner saw: "second images not loaded properly".
 *
 * Deduplicated because the cover is usually also the first entry of the set,
 * and a shop that uploaded one photo should not get a two-photo carousel of
 * the same picture.
