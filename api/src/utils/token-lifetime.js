 * HOW LONG A HANDSET STAYS SIGNED IN, which is a different question.
 *
 * Owner: "username password not saved already. everytime i need to enter."
 *
 * He was not describing a bug in the app's memory. The handset keeps its
 * credential perfectly well; it expired. A till token lasting a day is right,
 * because a till is a fixed machine somebody signs into at the start of a
 * shift and it sits behind a counter.
 *
 * A HANDSET IS NOT THAT. It is carried by a part-time waiter who is handed it
 * at the start of a shift and does not know the shop's password, and a
 * credential that dies every 24 hours means somebody with the password has to
 * be found and brought over, at the start of every service, for every phone.
 * That is a support call a day per shop, for ever, produced by a number.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES A LONGER ONE SAFE HERE. A lost phone is cut off by freeing its
 * handset slot on the till - see src/handset-slots.js - which the till already
 * enforces and answers 403 to. That is a revocation a manager can actually
 * perform, which a token expiry is not: expiry does not protect the phone
 * today, it only inconveniences the shop tomorrow.
 *
 * Still a setting, so a shop that wants the old behaviour sets
 * HANDSET_JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h and gets it.
