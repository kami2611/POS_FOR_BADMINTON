 * The shop's currency, as a customer should read it beside a price.

 * A branch keeps its currency as the LABEL the signup dropdown showed:
 *
 *   "India Rupee / INR or ₹"
 *
 * Keeping the label is right - it is the thing the shopkeeper chose and the
 * thing the settings screen shows back. Printing it beside a price is not, and
 * that is what the public menu did on develop: "India Rupee / INR or ₹ 80"
 * beside every dish, because the page was handed the label and asked to be
 * polite about it.
 *
 * So the label is taken apart here, once, on the server, and the pages are
 * handed the two things they can actually use: the symbol to print and the
 * ISO code for anything that needs to be unambiguous (a receipt, a payment
 * gateway, a spreadsheet).
 *
 * Tolerant on purpose. Older installs and self-hosted ones have stored a bare
 * "INR", a bare "₹", "Rs." and the odd label with no " or " in it, and a menu
 * must never come out blank because a currency string was shaped unusually.
