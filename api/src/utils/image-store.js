 * Where a product image lives, and how both halves of the product find it.
 *
 * A till and the web app render the SAME string - a relative path, /uploads/<key>.
 * The browser resolves it against whichever origin it happens to be on:
 *
 *     till     http://localhost:5000/uploads/<key>
 *     web app  https://shop.example.com/uploads/<key>
 *
 * So nothing environment-specific is ever written to the database. That matters
 * because the alternative is what we already have: rows holding
 * "http://localhost:5000/uploads/x.jpg" that were correct on the machine that
 * created them and meaningless everywhere else, plus controller code that
 * detects and rewrites them on the way out.
 *
 * The key is the whole design:
 *
 *     <tenantId>/<kind>/<sha256>.<ext>
 *
 *     local   uploads/<key>
 *     S3      s3://<bucket>/<key>
 *
 * One string, both locations derived from it. Keyed by the tenant's ObjectId
 * rather than its subdomain or shop name, because those change - a shop
 * rebrands, moves domain, gets renamed - and an id does not. Content-hashed,
 * so the same photo uploaded twice is one object and a retry after a dropped
 * connection is a no-op rather than a duplicate.
 *
 * Reading prefers local, always. A shop with the line down still shows its
 * images, because the file is on the disk in front of the person using it.
 * S3 is the origin; the disk is the cache; the till never waits on a network
 * to draw something it has already seen.
