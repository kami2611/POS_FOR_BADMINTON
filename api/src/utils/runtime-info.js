// The one answer to "where am I running and which version is this?"
// (PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE §1; SEAMLESS_UPDATE_ROADMAP U1). The UI and the
// update machinery read this single endpoint instead of sniffing user agents
// or build flags - edition and mode are RUNTIME facts, never build forks.
//
// Modes:
//   desktop - the API is running in-process inside the Electron shell
//             (main.js sets POSNIC_DESKTOP=1 before requiring the server)
//   cloud   - a provisioned tenant process (the provisioner's env carries the
//             per-shop POSNIC_KEY; POSNIC_CLOUD=1 is the explicit override)
//   local   - anything else: a community self-hosted server / LAN host
//
// Edition follows mode: cloud => 'cloud' (branded), otherwise 'community'.
//
// The app version is the ROOT package version (the only one users and the
// updater see). Resolution: POSNIC_APP_VERSION env (set by the desktop shell)
// -> ../package.json next to the api directory (dev tree / bundled layouts)
// -> null. Null is deliberate: reporting an unrelated number (api/package.json
// says 2.0.0 forever) would be worse than admitting we don't know.

/**
 * Does this installation belong to somebody with a Posnic account?

 * Not the same question as the mode, and the difference is the whole point.
 * resolveMode() answers 'desktop' before it looks at anything else, so a till
 * PAIRED TO CLOUD - a paying customer, standing at their own counter - reports
 * edition 'community'. That is right for the update channel and wrong for
 * "show me my account", which is why this is its own flag rather than a test
 * on edition somewhere in the frontend.
 *
 * Two ways to be true:
 *   cloud mode          - a provisioned tenant process
 *   POSNIC_SYNC_PAIRED  - the desktop shell found a cloud config with a
 *                         gateway on it, so this till is enrolled
 *
 * FALSE IS THE SAFE ANSWER and the default. A community shop sent to an
 * account page that greets them with "no account found" is worse off than one
 * that was never offered the link.
 *
 * A white-labelled build never offers it: that installation is not called
 * Posnic, and sending its owner to posnic.com would break the rebrand it was
 * sold as.
