 * The address to put in an email, when the shop is the one sending it.
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG.
 *
 * Forgot-password built its link like this:
 *
 *   const serverName = process.env.SERVER_NAME || 'localhost';
 *   ... else if (cleanServerName.includes('localhost'))
 *         basePath = `${process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 'http://localhost:3000'}/...`
 *
 * SERVER_NAME is set on no process in the estate. Neither is FRONTEND_URL. So
 * every cloud shop's reset email carried a link to
 * http://localhost:3000/forgotpassword.html - the recipient's own computer, on
 * a port with nothing listening. Self-service password recovery has therefore
 * never worked for a hosted shop, which is why a locked-out owner needed five
 * days and a database session to get back into his own till.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT JUST `req.headers.host`.
 *
 * Password-reset poisoning is the oldest trick against exactly this code. Send
 * `Host: evil.example` to the reset endpoint, and the victim gets a real email,
 * from us, containing a link that hands their token to somebody else. The host
 * header is written by whoever is calling; it is not evidence of anything.
 *
 * This application cannot simply trust it either: unlike some multi-tenant
 * designs, the host does NOT select the database here - the process already
 * knows its shop - so a forged host would be accepted by everything downstream
 * without anybody noticing.
 *
 * So the order is: what an operator configured, then a host that matches a
 * domain we actually run, and nothing else. A shop with no answer sends no
 * link, because a dead link and a poisoned link are both worse than an error
 * we can see.
 */

/*
 * The domains this company serves shops on. A host must end in one of these,
 * or be exactly one of them, before it may appear in an email we send.
 *
 * The three built in are ours and always have been. The rest come from
 * SHOP_BASE_DOMAINS, the same variable the shard reads to decide which names a
 * shop answers to, so the two cannot disagree: a shop served at
 * cusxyz.xbill.in would otherwise be told its own address is untrusted and
 * send no link at all, which is the dead-link failure this file exists to
 * prevent.
 *
 * A reseller's customer on their own domain still goes through
 * PUBLIC_EXTRA_DOMAINS below. That list is per-instance and set by hand, which
 * does not scale to a channel; the plan to make it per-shop is a separate
 * change and this one does not pretend to make it.
