/*
 * The one place that talks to S3.
 *
 * Three files used to build their own client with `require("aws-sdk")` - AWS
 * SDK v2, which package.json has never declared and which reached end of life
 * in 2025. The require sits inside the upload branch rather than at the top of
 * the file, so the modules load fine and nothing complains until a shop
 * actually switches storage to S3 and uploads an item image. Then it throws
 * "Cannot find module 'aws-sdk'" and returns a 500 with no useful message.
 *
 * @aws-sdk/client-s3 - v3 - was already declared and already in use in
 * sms.service.js, so the fix was to use the SDK this project had chosen rather
 * than install a dead one.
 *
 * One behavioural note. v2's `upload()` resolved with a `Location`, and the
 * controllers return that URL to the browser. v3's PutObjectCommand returns no
 * such field, so uploadObject builds it - which means the URL is now
 * constructed from the bucket and region rather than reported by AWS. For the
 * standard bucket-in-region case they are the same string. A custom endpoint,
 * an accelerated transfer or a CNAME in front of the bucket would differ, and
 * AWS_S3_PUBLIC_URL is the override for exactly that.
