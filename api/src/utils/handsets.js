/*
 * WHICH PHONES THIS SHOP HAS, AND WHETHER ONE OF THEM STILL MAY.
 *
 * Owner: "once logged in use jwt or proper app authendication system. map
 * device to cloud account."
 *
 * The first half was already true. A handset signs in once with a username
 * and a password and is handed a bearer token, which is the only thing it
 * presents from then on; the password is never stored on the phone. That is
 * the proper authentication system, and it stays.
 *
 * THE SECOND HALF WAS NOT. A phone described itself on every ORDER it sent -
 * its model, its platform, a random id it keeps for itself - and an order was
 * the only place any of it was ever written down. So a shop had no list of
 * its own handsets, and no answer to the one question that matters when a
 * phone goes missing: stop THAT phone, and leave the other four working.
 *
 * An expiry is not an answer to it. It does nothing about the phone in
 * somebody's pocket tonight and inconveniences the shop in a month, which is
 * the trade that made a waiter find a manager every morning.
 *
 * So a sign-in writes the phone down against the account, and the token it is
 * given names the phone. A shop can see its handsets and turn one off, and
 * the one that was turned off stops the next time it asks for anything.
 *
 * A REVOKED PHONE THAT SIGNS IN AGAIN COMES BACK, and that is deliberate.
 * The whole premise of this feature is that a waiter does not know the shop's
 * password: somebody who can type it is somebody the shop trusts with the
 * till. Revoking is for the phone in a taxi, not for keeping a manager out.

/*
 * A revoke has to be felt by the request AFTER it, not by the request after
 * the next database round trip. But a lookup on every call from every phone
 * on a floor is a query per tap, so the answer is held for a moment.
 *
 * Thirty seconds, and a revoke performed in THIS process clears the entry
 * immediately. A shop served by more than one process (the till serves two)
 * can therefore take up to the window for the others to notice, which is the
 * honest cost of not querying per tap and is far below the time it takes to
 * notice a phone is gone.
