/**
 * Take the secrets out of anything about to be logged.
 *
 * A real password reached a real log file on a real machine:
 *
 *   [LOGIN] Request body: { username: 'sri@test.com', password: 'Reset@123' }
 *
 * Two controllers logged `req.body` whole while debugging a login problem,
 * which is the most natural thing in the world to write and the worst possible
 * object to print. The file it lands in is the one a shop sends us when they
 * need help - so the password travels to us by email, sits in an inbox, and
 * gets forwarded on with the rest of the thread.
 *
 * Redacting at the point of logging rather than removing the log lines: the
 * lines are useful, and a rule that says "never log the body" is one somebody
 * breaks the next time they are debugging at midnight. This makes the safe
 * thing the easy thing.
 *
 * Keys are matched by name and case-insensitively, on the way down through
 * nested objects, because a password is as likely to be at data.user.password
 * as at the top.
