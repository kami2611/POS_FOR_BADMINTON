/*
 * THE PHONES THIS SHOP HAS, AND THE SWITCH THAT STOPS ONE.
 *
 * Owner: "map device to cloud account."
 *
 * A handset signs in with a username and a password and is given a token that
 * lasts thirty days, because a part-time waiter who does not know the shop's
 * password cannot be made to find a manager every morning. That is right, and
 * it is only safe while the shop can stop one phone without stopping the rest.
 *
 * So: a list of what has signed in, and a switch beside each one.
 *
 * WHY A LIST AND NOT A COUNT. "Four handsets" is not a thing anybody can act
 * on. The model, who last used it, and when it was last seen are what let
 * somebody point at the row that is the phone left in a taxi last night.
 *
 * Behind `protect`, so this is the till and the browser, never the handset:
 * a phone cannot list the shop's phones, and cannot turn another one off.
