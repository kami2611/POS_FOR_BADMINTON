/*
 * Serving an image, from whichever of the two places currently has it.
 *
 * The client asks for /uploads/<key> and does not know or care where the bytes
 * come from. That indirection is the entire reason a till and the web app can
 * render the same string: each resolves the relative path against its own
 * origin, and the server on the other end answers from whatever it has.
 *
 *     on disk        stream it. No network, so this works with the line down,
 *                    which is the case that matters - a shop mid-sale should
 *                    never wait on the internet to draw a product photo.
 *
 *     not on disk    fetch from S3 once, answer the request, and keep a copy.
 *                    A new till, or one that was reinstalled, heals itself the
 *                    first time somebody looks at each image.
 *
 * express.static still sits in front of this for the common case; this handles
 * the miss. Keys are content-addressed, so a file that exists is by definition
 * the right file and can be cached hard.
