/*
 * Where a till's dying words land.
 *
 * Owner, after clearing his own browser data to recover a white page:
 * "i dont [want] users to face these kind of errors."
 *
 * The white-page bug this follows lived for months because it was CLIENT
 * side: the server answered 200 to everything, every log stayed clean, and
 * the only witness was a browser console nobody was looking at. Diagnosing
 * it took minting a shadow session and booting it in headless Chrome. This
 * endpoint is the cheap version of that pipeline, always on: the boot
 * watchdog posts the first uncaught error here, and it lands in the shop's
 * own pm2 log - `grep client-error` - beside the request lines it belongs
 * with.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY UNAUTHENTICATED. The errors worth hearing about most are the
 * ones that happen BEFORE auth works - a boot that dies has no token to
 * present. Unauthenticated write surface is held small three ways:
 *
 *   - it stores nothing: one console line, no database, nothing to fill
 *   - per-IP budget: after a handful an hour, requests are counted and
 *     dropped without logging, so a hostile loop cannot flood the log
 *   - every field is truncated before it is printed
 *
 * It always answers 204, error or not: a crash reporter that can itself
 * produce visible failures adds noise to the exact moment that has too
 * much of it.
