/*
 * A shop's online ordering channel, as the outside world sees it.
 *
 * ONE RESOURCE, ADDRESSED BY THE SHOP'S PUBLIC STORE ADDRESS.
 *
 * This replaces three endpoints that each did part of the job under a name
 * describing how the customer happened to arrive:
 *
 *   POST /items/accessQr        the menu, for a phone that scanned a code
 *   POST /items/accesskiosk     the same menu, for the shop's own terminal
 *   POST /sales/qrOrder         an order, from either
 *
 * The transport is not the resource. A customer reaches the same storefront by
 * scanning a code on a table, following a link in a message, tapping a button
 * on a search listing, or standing at a terminal in the shop, and none of those
 * should be a separate endpoint under a different noun. So there is one
 * storefront, named for what it is, and the door it was opened by stops
 * mattering.
 *
 * All of it is anonymous, because a customer's phone has no credentials. The
 * STORE ADDRESS is the opt-in: a branch that never chose one cannot be reached
 * here, and a branch's raw database id - which appears in every authenticated
 * response and is no secret - buys nothing. The shop's own equipment presents
 * the installation's kiosk key and gets the extra fields it needs to take
 * payment and print, which a customer's phone never sees.
