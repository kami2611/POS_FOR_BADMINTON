/*
 * What may leave this machine, and in what form.
 *
 * There was no such list. Every field a model stored was implicitly eligible to
 * be synced in plain text, which is how a shop's Razorpay secret key ends up
 * somewhere nobody decided to put it. The database already holds, in the clear:
 *
 *   branch.payment_gateway          Razorpay key and secret
 *   branch.phonepe_payment_gateway  PhonePe merchant credentials
 *   branch.smtp_password            the shop's email password
 *   branch.way2sms_password         the shop's SMS provider password
 *
 * Those are not business records. They are credentials that let somebody take
 * payments and send messages as the merchant, and they are worth more to a
 * thief than the sales history sitting beside them.
 *
 * Four policies. The distinction that matters is the last one: it is
 * conditional, not fixed.
 *
 *   LOCAL_ONLY      never leaves this machine, in any edition
 *   SYNC_PLAIN      ordinary business data - items, sales, customers
 *   SYNC_ENCRYPTED  synced as ciphertext; Cloud stores it and cannot read it
 *   CLOUD_ONLY      belongs in Cloud when there is one, and is never written to
 *                   the till; falls back to encrypted-local when there is not
 *
 * CLOUD_ONLY is the right answer for the four fields above once Cloud exists.
 * They are used only for operations that already require the internet - an
 * online payment, an email, an SMS - so moving them server-side costs no
 * offline capability, and it matches what payment providers require: a secret
 * key must not live in a client application, and a till is a client
 * application.
 *
 * Until Cloud carries them, they are encrypted locally. This file is what makes
 * that a decision rather than an oversight, and field-policy.test.js fails if a
 * field that looks like a secret is added without one.
