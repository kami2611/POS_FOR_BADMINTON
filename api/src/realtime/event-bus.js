 * Per-shop realtime event bus (SEAMLESS_EXPERIENCE S2).
 *
 * One process serves one shop (or, on a shard, several - which is why every
 * operation here is keyed by database name). A write anywhere in the API
 * publishes a small invalidation signal - {type, entity} - and every till
 * the shop has open receives it over SSE within milliseconds. The signal
 * deliberately carries NO data: the till refreshes through the same
 * authenticated endpoints it already uses, so the channel can never leak
 * something the requester could not have fetched, and a lost event costs a
 * poll interval, not correctness.
 *
 * Plain in-process sets, no broker: the process IS the shop, so fan-out is
 * a for-loop. On a shard, tenants are isolated by key and one shop's events
 * never reach another's tills.
