#
# Ring-ordered tenant reload with a smoke gate between rings (U3.2).
#
# Runs ON the tenant instance, invoked by deploy-api.yml after rsync and
# npm ci. The code on disk is already new everywhere; what this orders is
# WHICH PROCESSES LOAD IT, so a bad build is discovered by the canary ring
# while every later ring keeps answering with the previous build. A halt
# here is recoverable by pushing a fix or re-running the previous deploy;
# a bad build loaded by all twenty shops at once is a support fire.
#
# Rings come from a file the operator owns on the server - nothing in the
# repo decides which shop is a canary:
#
#   ~/apps/admin/provisioning/rings.json
#   {
#     "rings": [
#       { "name": "canary", "match": ["posnic-shard-1"] },
#       { "name": "beta",   "match": ["posnic-tenant-a*"] }
#     ]
#   }
#
# match entries are glob-ish (* wildcards). Online processes not claimed
# by any ring form the final "ga" ring automatically. No rings file means
# ONE ring holding everything - exactly the single-pass deploy this
# replaces, so an instance without the file behaves as before.
#
# Inherited rules, learned the hard way (see deploy-api.yml history):
#   - No pm2 --update-env: it would overwrite each tenant's cached PORT
#     and MONGODB_URI with this SSH session's environment.
#   - Reload one process per pm2 call: `pm2 reload a b c` acts on the
#     first name only and exits 0.
#   - Only processes currently ONLINE: `pm2 reload` on a stopped process
#     STARTS it, and stopped per-shop processes are the rollback for
#     shops consolidated onto the shard.
#   - THIS LOG IS PUBLIC (open-source repo, Actions logs world-readable).
#     Print counts and ring names, never tenant process names - except on
#     a failure, where the name is the actionable fact.
