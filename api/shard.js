/*
 * One process, many shops.
 *
 * A shop today is its own Node process: ~125MB of runtime and modules, plus
 * about 6MB of anything that is actually the shop. Twenty-one shops on the first
 * machine cost 2.6GB, and in eleven hours of measurement they served 318
 * requests between them. A trial that never rings a sale costs exactly what the
 * busiest customer costs, because the tax is the runtime, not the tenant.
 *
 * This serves all of them from one process. The saving is the duplicate runtime:
 * 21 x 125MB becomes one x ~125MB plus 21 x ~6MB.
 *
 * The whole design rests on two seams that already exist and are tested:
 *
 *   - src/db/tenant-context.js carries the shop in AsyncLocalStorage, so a
 *     request keeps its identity across every await without threading an
 *     argument through twelve layers. In multi-tenant mode it THROWS rather
 *     than falling back to a process-wide handle, because the fallback is the
 *     leak: it would quietly serve one shop's data to another;
 *   - currentSecret() does the same for JWT_SECRET and the encryption keys.
 *     Those are per shop, and reading them from process.env here would mean a
 *     token minted for one customer verifying for another - worse than the
 *     wrong database, because nothing about it is visible from inside either
 *     shop.
 *
 * What this file adds is the front door: Host header -> which shop -> open the
 * scope -> hand the request to the same express app a single-shop process runs.
