 * The shop's own online ordering page.

 * Served from the shop's origin so it is the same origin as the API it calls:
 * no CORS list to keep per shop, and - the part that actually bit customers -
 * no shared browser storage. The kiosk used to live on one host for the whole
 * estate, where IndexedDB is per-origin and therefore shared, which is why it
 * had to wipe its catalogue whenever it noticed a different branch. A customer
 * who ordered at two Posnic shops collided with themselves.
 *
 * TWO PAGES, NOT ONE BUNDLE WEARING TWO NAMES.
 *
 * `/menu` used to be `/order` with the cart hidden. That is a worse menu than
 * the paper it replaces: it carries 1,500 lines of IndexedDB, a cart and two
 * payment integrations to render a list of dishes, and it reads as a shop
 * that has taken its ordering away rather than as a menu.
 *
 * So they are separate bundles with separate jobs. `/order` transacts.
 * `/menu` is read-only: what the kitchen cooks, searchable, by category, with
 * the veg mark, and nothing on it that starts an order. A shop with ordering
 * switched on can still print a `/menu` code for its window; a shop in menu
 * mode has only ever needed this one.
 *
 * Mounted BEFORE the root API router, which answers `/items/...` and friends,
 * because that router is mounted at '/' and would otherwise see these paths
 * first. express.static redirects `/order` to `/order/` on its own, which is
 * what makes each bundle's relative asset paths resolve.
