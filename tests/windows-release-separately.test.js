/*
 * Windows is built and published from a desk, not from CI.
 *
 * Its code signing key lives on a Certum card. CA/Browser Forum rules have put
 * code signing keys on certified hardware since June 2023, so there is no .pfx
 * and no secret - and a GitHub-hosted runner has no card reader. A Windows
 * build produced in CI could only ever be UNSIGNED, which is worse than no
 * build at all: it looks finished and tells every customer the publisher is
 * unknown.
 *
 * The risk this file guards is not the pipeline breaking. It is the pipeline
 * working perfectly and shipping the wrong bytes - an unsigned installer, or a
 * signed one whose latest.yml describes a different build. Neither announces
 * itself; the second one stops auto-update on every till in the field without
 * a single error anywhere.
