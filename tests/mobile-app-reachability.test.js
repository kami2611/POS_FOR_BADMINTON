/*
 * What a phone on the shop Wi-Fi needs from this API, pinned.
 *
 * Two things were broken at once, and each hid the other.
 *
 * The table-ordering app finds the till by asking every address on the network
 * whether it is a Posnic server. The only endpoint that can answer honestly is
 * /api/runtime-info, and it - along with /api/healthz and /api/readyz - was
 * registered near the top of app.js, several hundred lines ABOVE the CORS
 * middleware. So the answer came back without Access-Control-Allow-Origin and
 * the browser threw it away. Discovery fell back to "something replied on port
 * 5555", which a printer or a router admin page satisfies just as well.
 *
 * And once connected, the app signed in through /users/kioskMobileLogin, which
 * authenticates properly and then hands back no credential at all. Every
 * screen after the branch list calls a route behind protectOrKioskKey, so the
 * login succeeded and the app then loaded nothing.
 *
 * These tests read the source rather than standing up the server: the ordering
 * of middleware IS the bug, and an integration test that mounts the app would
 * pass whether or not the order was preserved by a later edit.
