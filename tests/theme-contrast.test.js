 * Every theme, checked for the combinations nobody can read.
 *
 * A shop picks a theme from a grid of swatches and never sees the pairing until
 * it is on a counter: white text on a white card, grey on grey, an active menu
 * item whose label vanishes into its own highlight. Nothing errors, no test
 * fails, and the shop concludes the software is broken.
 *
 * There are about a dozen presets and each carries about a dozen colours, so
 * this is not something to check by eye - and checking it by eye is exactly what
 * has been happening. The thresholds are WCAG 2.1: 4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for
 * large text and for things that are shapes rather than words.
 *
 * The presets are read out of themeManager.js rather than duplicated here. A
 * copy would be wrong the first time somebody added a theme, and then this file
 * would be checking colours nobody ships.
