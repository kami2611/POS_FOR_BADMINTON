/*
 * What the paper calls itself, before and after the customer pays.
 *
 * Owner: "before pay customer that print out called what? what to name? as per
 * international standard. second after customer pay we give receipt what to
 * call?" Then, on the answer: "okay fine tax invoice and recotp okay... i am
 * okay with within india Bill. up to you and standards."
 *
 * A receipt is proof that money changed hands. Nothing handed over BEFORE
 * payment may be called one, and both prints were headed SALES RECEIPT - the
 * shop's configurable default - so the customer got a "receipt" for a meal
 * they had not paid for, then another one after paying. The bill a waiter
 * carries from the floor had no heading at all, because that path sends the
 * raw sale and a sale carries no title.
 *
 * The rule, which is law and not taste: a GST-registered shop issues a TAX
 * INVOICE for the supply, and in a restaurant that is the document presented
 * for payment. A shop with no GST issues a BILL. What follows payment is a
 * RECEIPT, carrying the SAME invoice number - one sale, one number.
 *
 * THE UNPAID STAMP IS GONE. It was here, on both prints, and the owner read
 * one off the roll: "No need to print 'Unpaid' near Tax Invoice." A document
 * presented at a table asking for money is unpaid by definition, so the word
 * adds nothing the heading does not already say, and a customer's copy stamped
 * UNPAID reads as an accusation rather than a request. The heading carries the
 * distinction on its own.
