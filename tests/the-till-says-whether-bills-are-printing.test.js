/*
 * WHAT HARDWARE MANAGER TELLS A SHOPKEEPER ABOUT BILLS.
 *
 * A waiter taps Print bill and nothing comes out. Before this, the reason
 * lived in a console window nobody has open on a shop floor, so "it is not
 * printing" and "no receipt printer is set on this till" were the same
 * sentence to the person standing at the counter - and one of those they can
 * fix in ten seconds.
 *
 * BillManager had kept a status object since it was written and nothing ever
 * asked for it. That is the shape of bug this file exists to stop: a reading
 * that is taken, is correct, and reaches nobody.
 *
 * The functions are read OUT of hardware-manager.html rather than copied, so
 * the test cannot keep passing while the screen does something else.
