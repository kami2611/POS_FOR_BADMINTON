 * The shop's online ordering page, as the shop's own process serves it.
 *
 * Everything here is load-bearing and invisible until a customer hits it:
 *
 * 1. The bundle is mounted BEFORE the API router. That router is mounted at
 *    '/', so it sees every path; mount the bundle after it and `/order` stops
 *    being a page and starts being a 404 from the API.
 *
 * 2. Nothing in the bundle names a host. It is served by the shop's own
 *    process, so every call is relative to the page's own origin. A hardcoded
 *    backend is how one server came to answer for every shop in the estate.
 *
 * 3. Every page that talks to the API also loads the channel state. Miss one
 *    and that page shows a working cart for a shop that is closed.
 *
 * 4. The rules that hide the cart point at controls that exist. A stylesheet
 *    full of selectors matching nothing is the quietest possible failure:
 *    everything looks right, and the checkout button is still there.
