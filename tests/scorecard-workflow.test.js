  /* v4.38.0. Verified against upstream before approving, the same way the
     previous pin was and for the same reason - a bump arrives as a SHA and a
     trailing comment, and the comment is written by whoever opened the pull
     request, not by the registry:

       gh api repos/github/codeql-action/git/ref/tags/v4.38.0
         -> annotated tag 4bd7200e1f146b1c937cae12d258b50f41a53cf8
       gh api repos/github/codeql-action/git/tags/4bd7200e...
         -> commit b96794f015dfd88f77b49b1c93e0fa7110f94c63

     which is the commit the workflow now pins. Dereference the ANNOTATED TAG,
     not the ref: refs/tags/vX for a signed release points at a tag object, and
     reading .object.sha off the ref gives the tag, not the commit it names.

     Do this again for the next bump rather than trusting the comment. */
