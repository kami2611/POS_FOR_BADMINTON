/*
 * The kitchen printer starts with the till, not when somebody opens a window.
 *
 * Owner, from a restaurant: "prints are very slow. as soon receive order it
 * needs to print."
 *
 * Constructing KOTManager is not the same as running it. The only caller of
 * startPolling lived inside the Hardware Manager window, and _onKotEvent
 * returns on its first line unless isPolling. So after every restart, update
 * or power cut a kitchen printed NOTHING - not by the event, and not by the
 * thirty second safety net, because neither was running - until a person
 * opened that window and landed on the KOT tab. To a kitchen that presents as
 * "very slow": the tickets arrive whenever somebody opens a settings screen.
 *
 * BillManager beside it has always started itself, and says so in its own
 * comment. These pin the asymmetry closed.
