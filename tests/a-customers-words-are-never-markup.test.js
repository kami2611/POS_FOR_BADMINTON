/*
 * What a customer types reaches a shop's screens, and must arrive as words.
 *
 * Almost every XSS alert CodeQL raises on this codebase is the shop's own data
 * on the shop's own till: a value read back out of the sale screen's DOM and
 * put into the next row. A shopkeeper who types a script tag into their own
 * item name and then watches it run on their own till has not been attacked.
 *
 * THREE SURFACES ARE DIFFERENT, because the text on them comes from outside:
 *
 *   the online orders queue   a customer's name, address, delivery note, and
 *                             the note they put on a single dish
 *   the request dock          the same order, as a card over the till
 *   the kitchen screen        the ticket on the wall
 *
 * Anyone with the shop's ordering link can put anything they like in those.
 * All three escape today; this is what says so tomorrow. Written as
 * BEHAVIOUR - a real payload through the real renderer - rather than as a
 * search for the word `safe(`, because the question is what comes out, and a
 * search would pass on a field somebody escaped the wrong way.
