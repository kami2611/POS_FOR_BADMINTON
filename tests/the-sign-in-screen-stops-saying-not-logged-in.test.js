 * A sign-in screen has no session. That is not something to shout about.

 * Owner, opening a freshly downloaded till: "i see same error as soon firts
 * time cloud download. i think as suggest i dont want auto login. but remove
 * this error."
 *
 * The red toast said "You are not logged in!" across the sign-in form, and it
 * read as the cloud sign-in having failed. Nothing had failed. The page fetches
 * its theme and its settings before anybody has typed a password, the server
 * answers 401 because there is no session yet, and the failure handler toasted
 * whatever sentence came back with it.
 *
 * What must NOT change: a wrong password still has to say so, and every 401
 * away from the sign-in screen still has to send the person back to it.
 *
 * These tests run the shipped failure handler itself, lifted out of ajax.js and
 * handed a fake till, so they exercise the branching rather than describe it.
