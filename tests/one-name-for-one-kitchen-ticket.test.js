/*
 * The till and the server call the same piece of paper the same thing.
 *
 * WHY THIS HAD TO EXIST BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE
 *
 * The till computes a key for every ticket - sale, type, and a hash of the
 * contents - and uses it twice: to skip one it has already printed, and to
 * write the durable claim in print-ledger.js that stops a restart reprinting
 * the lot.
 *
 * The SERVER never knew that key. It handed out sales and was told "these are
 * printed", and the two sides described the same paper in different words. So
 * the question this whole area turns on had no answer:
 *
 *     Did the ticket the server expected to print actually print?
 *
 * A queue cannot hold a thing it cannot name, and a shadow comparison between
 * the old path and the new one is impossible without one name. So the key came
 * out of kot-manager.js into a module both sides can use.
 *
 * THE RISK IN DOING THAT
 *
 * A changed key renames every ticket in flight on ninety shops: the ledger
 * stops recognising what it already printed, and a restart reprints a service.
 * So the extraction is pinned as byte-identical to the expression it replaced,
 * not merely "looks right".
