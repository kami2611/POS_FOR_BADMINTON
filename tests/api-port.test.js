/*
 * The API must serve on the port the app derived, not on 5555.
 *
 * Posnic picks its ports from the application name so two brands can be
 * installed on one machine without colliding, and so a stock install does not
 * fight whatever else is already on a common port. resolveLocalPorts does that
 * correctly, writes the answer to .ports.json and prints it at startup.
 *
 * main.js then threw it away. `const API_PORT = process.env.PORT || 5555` runs
 * when the module is first required - before app.whenReady, so PORT is unset
 * and the constant freezes at 5555 - and startServer() assigned that constant
 * back over process.env.PORT before handing control to server.js. Stock Posnic
 * advertised 42590 in .ports.json, in the log and through the get-api-port IPC
 * channel, and served 5555. Two branded installs would have collided on the one
 * port derived ports exist to avoid.
 *
 * These read main.js as text rather than loading it, because requiring main.js
 * starts an Electron application.
