 * A bill has to agree with itself.
 *
 * THE PAPER THE OWNER READ
 *
 *   Paneer Starter        2 x 240        480.00
 *   ...
 *   Subtotal                             400.00
 *
 * "paneer starter 2 x 240 its wrong. it supposed to 200. means 200 x 2. then we
 * add tax. its exlusive properly need to be displayed."
 *
 * Two things were wrong at once and they hid each other. The line printed the
 * tax-INCLUSIVE amount (240 a plate, 480 the line) while the subtotal below it
 * added the tax-EXCLUSIVE ones (400), and the unit price was never printed at
 * all - so the only number a customer could check the menu against was the one
 * with tax folded into it, and the two halves of the document disagreed by
 * exactly the tax.
 *
 * On an exclusive-tax bill the line is the pre-tax line. The tax is added once,
 * underneath, where it can be seen being added. Anything else is a bill that
 * charges tax twice on paper even when it collects it once.
 *
 * AND THREE THINGS THE BILL WAS SAYING THAT ARE NOT ITS BUSINESS
 *
 * "No need to print 'Unpaid' near Tax Invoice." / "'From' not required in the
 * bill. only kot fine." / "in the bill Table, order type, covers umber of items
 * not required. KOT fine. not in the bill."
 *
 * Each of those is the restaurant talking to itself. The kitchen ticket needs
 * every one of them and still prints them; the customer's copy carries what is
 * owed and why, and nothing else.
