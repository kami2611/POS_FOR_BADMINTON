/*
 * WHAT A CUSTOMER SEES BEFORE THE SHOP HAS SET TODAY'S PRICE.
 *
 * Owner, after two fish reached a kitchen worth nothing: "for menu and order
 * say its just market price. i will ask another prompt to make seperate flag
 * for these kind of items. dont let customer add or menu see the price. ask
 * for pricing. as of now. if price is set above 0 then you can show as normal
 * item. my intension is when shop open let them update the price."
 *
 * Whole fish, crab, lobster: the rate comes from the morning's market, so the
 * catalogue holds nothing until the shop opens and enters it. Both customer
 * surfaces printed that as 0.00 - which reads as free, and is the one thing a
 * displayed price must never do.
 *
 * THE FLAG CONTRACT has since landed: `daily_price` says a dish is priced from
 * the market, `price_set_on` says when somebody last did it. Priced today it
 * is an ordinary dish; priced yesterday it is not, which is the quiet failure
 * the flag exists to catch - a stale number looks right, and nobody checks a
 * price that looks right. An item carrying neither field still falls through
 * to "has it got a price at all", because shops are running this today.
 *
 * The rules are lifted out of the page and run for real here, rather than
 * matched as text: a regex over source cannot tell you that a price entered
 * yesterday evening is refused this morning.
