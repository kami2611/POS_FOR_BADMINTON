/*
 * What closing the till looks like, and what reopening it during that looks
 * like.
 *
 * Three separate behaviours, which used to be one:
 *
 *   Closing   - nothing on screen. The shop has finished; the windows go at
 *               once and the database finishes closing out of sight.
 *   Restarting- the screen stays, with the steps, because the till is expected
 *               back and the gap is where people conclude it has crashed.
 *   Updating  - always shown, because turning the machine off during it does
 *               real damage.
 *
 * And the one that was simply broken: closing Posnic and immediately reopening
 * it. The closing process still holds the single-instance lock, so the new one
 * failed to get it and called app.exit(0) - no window, no message. For the ten
 * seconds mongod needs to close its files the icon did nothing at all, and
 * clicking again did nothing again.
