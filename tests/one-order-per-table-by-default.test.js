/*
 * A table has one open order, unless the shop says otherwise.
 *
 * Owner: "basically two orders in single table not possible." Then, when asked
 * what the rule should be: "by default one order per tabel. inside restaurant
 * keep te settings. multiple order or only one order or maximum number of
 * order. keep the settings."
 *
 * This is NOT the duplicate-order bug. That one was a double tap on a handset
 * writing the same order twice, and it is fixed elsewhere with a key on the
 * order and a unique index behind it. This is the different, deliberate case:
 * a second order, genuinely placed, on a table that already has one open. On
 * most floors that is somebody choosing the wrong table, and the cost of
 * finding out is a bill split in two at the end of the meal.
 *
 * One integer holds the whole rule, because that is what a count is compared
 * against:
 *
 *   1   one open order per table. The default.
 *   0   no limit. Some shops genuinely run a ticket per round.
 *   N   at most N.
 *
 * The dropdown and the number box on the settings screen are a way of typing
 * that integer without asking a shopkeeper to know that zero means unlimited.
