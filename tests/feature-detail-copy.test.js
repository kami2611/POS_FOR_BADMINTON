 * The feature detail dialogs (FEATURE_PAGES_DESIGN).
 *
 * Every Core feature opens like a marketplace listing. Nine of them opened with
 * nothing but their one-line card description, which reads as unfinished rather
 * than as "no detail available" - so the copy was written on 2026-08-21.
 *
 * These tests exist for the two ways that copy can be wrong in a way nobody
 * notices: a feature that has no entry at all, and a `section` anchor naming a
 * markup block that does not exist. The renderer guards the second with
 * $(info.section).length, so an invented anchor breaks nothing and sits there
 * reading as wired - which is precisely why it needs a test rather than a
 * glance. The first draft of this copy invented SEVEN of them.
