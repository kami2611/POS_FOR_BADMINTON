/*
 * One PowerShell, kept warm, instead of one per copy of every receipt.
 *
 * Owner: "receipt prniter is direct connection right, why its not fired
 * immediately... every seconds counts here. so give proper solution."
 *
 * Measured on a real Windows till before this:
 *
 *   powershell -File, trivial script       546 ms
 *   powershell -File, the real print script 350-550 ms   <- paid PER COPY
 *   cmd.exe, which cannot call winspool      18 ms
 *   this helper, once warm                    1-2 ms
 *
 * Most of the cost is not the shell, it is Add-Type compiling the C# interop
 * class on every run. Started once, it compiles once.
 *
 * The functional half only runs on Windows, because that is the only platform
 * with a spooler to talk to; mac and Linux go to `lp`, which starts in
 * milliseconds and needs nothing kept warm.
