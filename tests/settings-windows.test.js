/*
 * The settings windows: their tabs, and the theme laid over them.
 *
 * Two faults shipped together in one installer, from opposite directions.
 *
 * Clicking Receipt Printer blanked the window. switchTab clears .active from
 * every panel and then looks the requested one up in tabMap - and tabMap had no
 * 'receipt' key, so it cleared everything and showed nothing. It looked fine
 * until you clicked, because that panel is marked active in the markup and
 * starts out visible. The first click was what broke it.
 *
 * And every gradient button rendered as an empty white box. window-theme.css
 * opened with `button, .btn { background-image: none !important }` to strip the
 * template gradients. Those buttons are styled inline as
 * `background: linear-gradient(...); color: #fff` - the shorthand leaves
 * background-color transparent, so the gradient IS the background. An
 * !important rule beats a plain inline style, so they lost their only
 * background, kept their white text, and became white on white.
 *
 * Both are the same shape of mistake: something was taken away without checking
 * what depended on it.
