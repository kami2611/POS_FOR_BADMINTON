/*
 * Which routes an anonymous caller may reach.
 *
 * Written before making this repository public, because publishing the source
 * turns "nobody knows the endpoint exists" into no protection at all.
 *
 * A group of sales routes ran behind optionalProtect and nothing else.
 * optionalProtect tries to authenticate and never refuses, so a caller who
 * simply did not authenticate carried on as anonymous - and the handlers, with
 * no session to read the branch from, took it from the request instead:
 * req.body.branch_id, req.query.branchId, req.body.order_id.
 *
 * The effect was that anyone who could reach the API could name any branch of
 * any shop and read its live tables, its order history, its catalogue and its
 * printed receipts. updateOrder went further: it accepts items, totals and
 * discounts, so an anonymous request could rewrite what another shop's order
 * said it cost.
 *
 * These tests fix the list of routes that may be reached without a session, and
 * require the rest to prove they are the shop's own equipment.
