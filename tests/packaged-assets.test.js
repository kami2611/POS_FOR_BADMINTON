/*
 * Every file a packaged window asks for must actually be in the package.
 *
 * Written after shipping an installer in which the four settings windows each
 * carried <script src="window-theme.js"> and the file was not in build.files.
 * Nothing failed loudly: electron-builder does not read the HTML, the window
 * still opened, and the missing script only meant the shop's theme was silently
 * not applied - the exact bug the script existed to fix, reintroduced by the
 * packaging rather than by the code. Both the source and the tests were green.
 *
 * So this reads what the windows reference and checks it against what the build
 * is told to include. It is the one place that sees both.
