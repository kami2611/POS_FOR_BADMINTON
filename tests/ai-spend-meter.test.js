 * Owner, on the release review that found live voice was not metered: "fix
 * it. better to meter and show the customer. otherwise he might be over
 * charged approximate bill value also based on current currency is better."
 *
 * The server side has its own tests (api/tests/unit/services/voice-meter,
 * ai-budget). This pins the two ends the shopkeeper meets: the settings
