/*
 * A table's call reaches the till, and the answer reaches the table.
 *
 * "A table can call somebody over" (7a0aac6e) wrote the call into whichever
 * database the ordering page was talking to - the cloud's - and marked the
 * collection synced. Two things stood between that row and the till's request
 * dock, and neither was visible from the feature's own tests:
 *
 *   NO LANE. The sync agent had no entry for waitercalls and the gateway
 *   accepted none. Built in Posnic/Gateway ("A call reaches the till"); the
 *   packaging guard in scripts/prepare-sync-agent.js is what noticed, by
 *   refusing a build on 2026-09-17.
 *
 *   NO DATE. The row was a native insert with no updated_date. The agent
 *   finds its work with { updated_date: { $exists: true } } and the gateway
 *   sends a till only rows whose updated_date moved. A lane would have
 *   carried nothing. Same trap as the settings save (#838), same family as
 *   the handset module nothing required: written, tested, read by nobody.
 *
 * Both writes are pinned here, because the second one is the one that gets
 * lost: marking a call seen at the till must move updated_date too, or the
 * cloud never learns the call was answered and the ordering page keeps
 * telling the customer "already calling".
