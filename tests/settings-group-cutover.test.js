/*
 * Frontend cutover to the per-group settings endpoints (design step S3).
 *
 * S1-S6 built a path where a partial save cannot demand a field it does not
 * own. None of that protects anyone until the screens actually call it, and
 * the screens that mattered are the three PARTIAL saves - the ones behind all
 * three production bugs of 2026-08-20:
 *
 *   - the signature upload, which returned "Default customer is required"
 *     because the shared validator demanded fields from another group
 *   - the feature toggles, which invented sales_prefix:'SAL' and
 *     receiving_prefix:'REC' to get past that same validator
 *   - the quotation defaults
 *
 * The whole-form saves legitimately span groups and stay on the legacy
 * endpoint, which is what the design means by "the god endpoint sees only
 * legacy traffic".
 *
 * The strongest assertion here compares each client payload against the
 * SERVER's own group map, so the two cannot drift apart in either direction.
