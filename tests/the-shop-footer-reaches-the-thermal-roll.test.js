/*
 * THE SHOP'S OWN WORDS REACH THE 80mm ROLL.
 *
 * Reported from a till: "Footer Content and Brand URL are saved and enabled,
 * and they appear correctly when printing A4. However, they do not appear at
 * all in Thermal preview or on the Thermal receipt, which still shows 'Thank
 * you, please visit again'."
 *
 * All of that was true, and none of it was the ESC/POS renderer, which has
 * handled `sale.footer` since it was written. The chain is:
 *
 *   settings.js      fills <span class="footer-content"> in BOTH stored
 *                    templates on every page load, from branch.footer_print
 *   sales_view.js    shows the block, takes .print-modal-body's HTML
 *   PosnicPro.js     hands that HTML to the ESC/POS path
 *   receipt-data.js  reads the sale back OUT of that HTML
 *
 * The last step gathered its footer from `.print-sale-notes` (a note typed on
 * one sale) and `.invoice-policy` (which in both templates holds the barcode
 * and is display:none). It never looked at `.footer-content` - the one element
 * that actually carries the shop's footer, sitting right there in the markup
 * it was handed. So `sale.footer` arrived empty every time, and the renderer's
 * fallback line was the only thing left to print.
 *
 * The brand URL missed for a different reason: printView appends it AFTER the
 * thermal branch has already returned, so it is not in that HTML at all. It is
 * read from the setting here instead.
 *
 * THIS TEST DRIVES THE REAL CHAIN: the real seeded template, the real jQuery,
 * the real extractor, the real renderer, and then decodes the bytes a printer
 * would receive. A test that asserted on source text would have passed while
 * the roll still said the wrong thing.
