/*
 * Telling a shopkeeper how to get an API key.
 *
 * "Paste the key from your provider" assumes they have one. Most will never
 * have opened a developer console, and the step people give up on is not
 * pasting the key, it is finding the page that issues one: every provider
 * buries it somewhere different.
 *
 * The part worth testing is not that help text exists. It is that the help
 * text is TRUE for the provider it is shown under, because the two places it
 * differs are both places where being wrong costs something:
 *
 *   - Gemini has a free allowance. Telling somebody they must add a card is
 *     false, and it is exactly the sentence that makes a person close the
 *     page and not come back.
 *   - Anthropic and OpenAI show the key once and never again. Not saying so
 *     means a shopkeeper closes the tab and has to make a second key, which
 *     reads as the software having lost it.
