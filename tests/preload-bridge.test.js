 * Every electronAPI method the renderer calls must exist on the preload bridge.
 *
 * A mismatch is invisible to both files: preload.js is valid, the caller is
 * valid, and nothing fails until a cashier presses the button and the renderer
 * throws "is not a function" into a console nobody is reading.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. The live weight display called
 * hardware.getLastWeight, which was never on the bridge - the method is
 * broadcastWeight. It threw on every till, every time, so the display was
 * never seeded with the last reading. On a scale that only transmits when the
 * load changes, that left the weight blank from the moment the shop opened
 * until someone put something on the platter, and the shop reported the scale
 * as not working.
