 * The build must not quietly produce an installer with no database in it.

 * MongoDB's server binaries used to be committed, so they were always there and
 * nobody had to think about it. They are not committed any more - 60MB of
 * somebody else's software under the SSPL, making every clone 130MB and this
 * repository a redistributor of a licence that is not its own.
 *
 * The dangerous part of that change is what electron-builder does when an
 * extraResources path is absent: nothing. No warning, no error. The installer is
 * built, it installs, and it fails on a shop's counter the first time it tries
 * to start its database - the worst possible place to find out.
 *
 * So a check runs before every build, and these tests keep the check honest:
 * it has to be wired in, and it has to be asking for the same files the build
 * actually copies.
