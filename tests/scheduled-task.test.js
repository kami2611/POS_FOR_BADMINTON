/*
 * The scheduled-task instructions, and the contract main.js has to honour for
 * them to be true.
 *
 * This module only prints text, so there is nothing to run and assert on. What
 * matters is that the text is correct for the machine reading it - a command
 * with a wrong path in it is worse than no command, because the shopkeeper
 * runs it, sees no error, and believes the backups are happening.
 *
 * The other half is the flag itself. The instructions promise Posnic.exe
 * understands --scheduled-task=backup, exits non-zero on failure, and stops the
 * database again afterwards. Those live in main.js, and if any of them drifts
 * the printed command becomes a lie.
