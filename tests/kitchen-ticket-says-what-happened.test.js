/*
 * What the kitchen ticket calls itself, and where the table is.
 *
 * Owner, on how a cook actually treats these: "we actually sent as item
 * cancelled even quantity reduced. for labours they dont care mostly. only
 * cancelled they just cancel while doing it. so keep as it is on this. when
 * whole order cancelled then send as Order cancelled instead of item
 * cancelled. one item or two item removal items cancelled okay. plural.
 * quantity reduced is bad for them."
 *
 * And earlier, on a second ticket for a table already served: "azure asking
 * like new order instead of modified order... with table number clearly
 * mentioned."
 *
 * So a reduction still prints as a cancellation, deliberately. What changes is
 * that losing a whole table's order and losing one line off it stop being the
 * same three words, and the table stops sharing a 13px line with the pax count
 * inside square brackets.
 *
 * These render real tickets rather than reading the template, because the
 * question is what comes out on paper.
