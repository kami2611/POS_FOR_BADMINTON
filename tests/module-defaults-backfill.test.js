/*
 * Giving existing shops explicit feature settings.
 *
 * "why these many activated already. this is not i wanted. when account
 * creation why its not created properly."
 *
 * New shops are fixed - they are created with four features on and the rest
 * off. Defaults only apply at creation, so every shop that already exists still
 * shows the full menu, and the reason is that a module reads as ON unless a
 * branch document explicitly says false. A shop that has never opened Settings
 * has no module_* keys at all.
 *
 * THE FAILURE MODE THIS FILE EXISTS FOR
 *
 * The obvious fix - change what "absent" means - would switch features off in
 * every shop already running. A shop taking credit sales for a year has no
 * module_credit_enable key either; it never needed one. Flip the convention,
 * deploy, and its Credit menu is gone overnight with its outstanding balances
 * unreachable, and nothing anywhere reports an error. The data is all still
 * there, which is exactly what makes it hard to diagnose: it reads as the
 * feature having been removed from the product.
 *
 * So the backfill writes explicit values decided from EVIDENCE, and every test
 * below is about not taking something away from somebody who is using it.
