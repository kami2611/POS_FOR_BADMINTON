/*
 * A switch nobody can reach is not a switch.
 *
 * The bill stopped printing the table number, the order type, the covers, the
 * steward, the item count and where the order came from, because the owner read
 * one and said so: "in the bill Table, order type, covers umber of items not
 * required. KOT fine. not in the bill."
 *
 * Then he sent a hotel restaurant's tax invoice printing every one of them:
 * "we have those as optional. no need to incluede... based on settings we can
 * add it. like toggle or desgn in one place for printing receipt."
 *
 * So the rows are switches, off by default, gathered on ONE card - the Receipt
 * Print tab that already holds Auto Print, Print Logo and Print Customer. A
 * setting that exists only in the payload reader is a row a shop can never get
 * back, which would have been a quiet loss dressed up as a fix.
 *
 * THIS TEST WALKS THE WHOLE CHAIN, because it has five links and any one of
 * them silently drops the value:
 *
 *   the card         frontend/modules/settings_write.html
 *   read + written   frontend/static/script/js/modules/js/settings.js
 *   coerced          api/src/models/setting.model.js
 *   stored           api/src/models/branch.model.js
 *   obeyed           api/src/helpers/bill-payload.js
