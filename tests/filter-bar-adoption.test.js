/*
 * The shared filter bar on the three busiest lists.
 *
 * list-filter.js was written "because it is going on every list - quotes,
 * items, sales, purchases" and for a long time only quotes had it. The five
 * controls it replaces worked, but could not say a filter was ON: the panel
 * closes and takes them with it, so a list narrowed to one supplier looks
 * exactly like a shop with one supplier, and the next person reports the list
 * as broken.
 *
 * Nine other lists still use the old pattern. That is deliberate and recorded -
 * these three carry the traffic, and a migration is worth doing in one piece
 * per screen rather than half-done across twelve.
