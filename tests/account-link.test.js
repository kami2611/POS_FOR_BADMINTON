 * The link to a shop's Posnic account, and who is allowed to see it.
 *
 * Two mistakes are easy here and both are silent.
 *
 * SHOWING IT TO THE WRONG SHOP. A community install has no account. Sending
 * its owner to posnic.com/account to be told "no account found" is worse than
 * never offering the link, and it is the sort of thing nobody reports - they
 * just decide the software is confused.
 *
 * HIDING IT FROM THE RIGHT ONE. resolveMode() answers 'desktop' before it looks
 * at anything else, so a till PAIRED TO CLOUD - a paying customer, standing at
 * their own counter - reports edition 'community'. A frontend test on edition
 * would hide the link from precisely the people it exists for. That is why the
 * decision is a server-side flag and not a string comparison in the browser.
