/*
 * Filling in a menu's nutrition, and the one thing that must not follow.
 *
 * Owner asked for nutrition on every dish and an assistant to fill it in "if
 * user lazy to do". The single-dish button does exactly that, one press at a
 * time - which on the 272-dish menu of a real shop is 272 presses. Left there
 * the panel is empty in every shop in the estate, and a feature that is empty
 * everywhere may as well not exist.
 *
 * So there is a pass over the whole menu. And the moment that exists, the
 * rule this whole feature was built on comes under a new kind of pressure.
 *
 * Until now the question could not arise: the only way numbers reached a dish
 * was a person typing them, or pressing Estimate and then Save. Either way a
 * person put them there, so every stored figure was somebody's word. A pass
 * that walks three hundred dishes unattended breaks that, and an unchecked
 * guess would start earning "Heart healthy" and "Diabetic friendly" on a live
 * menu - the same harm as a tick box for those words, arriving by a door that
 * is much harder to see.
 *
 * That is what most of this file is about.
