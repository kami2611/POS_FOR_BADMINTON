 * "No items yet - add your first item with the New button above" was shown for

 * none of them, was told its catalogue was empty and invited to start it. An
 * answer that is confidently wrong is worse than no answer: it sends somebody
 * looking for missing DATA instead of fixing their SEARCH.
 *
 * This is the quotes bug on the two most-used lists in the product. That one

 * the same lie reached a different way, which is why the fix is a shared
 * question - hasActiveFilters - rather than a message tweak on one screen.
