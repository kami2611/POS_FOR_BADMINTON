/*
 * The till showed a spinner for ever while every log line claimed success.
 *
 * Two independent pieces of startup raced. loadPageAndReveal() navigates the
 * main window to the dashboard or the login page; separately, a 2.5 second
 * timer shows loading.html if the window is not visible yet, on the reasoning
 * that someone staring at an empty desktop will double-click again.
 *
 * When startup finished at almost exactly 2.5 seconds - 2.75s on the run that
 * caught it - the order came out:
 *
 *   loadPageAndReveal starts navigating to dashboard.html
 *   the timer fires, loadFile('loading.html') ABORTS that navigation
 *   loading.html reaches dom-ready
 *   reveal() fires, because it listened for any dom-ready at all
 *   the promise resolves; the log prints "Dashboard visible" and
 *     "Saved login found - redirected directly to dashboard"
 *   markInterfaceReady writes interface=ready to health-status.json
 *   the user watches a progress ring until they kill the application
 *
 * Nothing reported a failure. did-fail-load ignores error -3, which is exactly
 * what an aborted navigation reports, so the one event that knew the truth was
 * discarded by design.
 *
 * Both halves are fixed: the timer stands down while a real navigation is in
 * flight, and reveal only settles for the page that was actually requested.
 * These read main.js as text - requiring it would start an Electron app.
