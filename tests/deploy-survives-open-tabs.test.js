 * A deploy must not break the tabs that are already open.

 * Owner: "mobile view add category shown and page broken. crashed." The
 * beacon log told the real story: no JS error at all - the page had lost
 * style/dashboard.<oldhash>.css with a 404. Ten deploys shipped that day;
 * each one ran rsync --delete on the tenant instance, so every deploy
 * deleted the bundles every already-open tab still referenced. The page
 * kept running, unstyled - which a person reads as "broken. crashed."
 *
 * Three layers, pinned together because any one alone can silently rot:
 *  1. the tenant deploy PROTECTS hashed bundles from --delete and prunes
 *     by family instead (newest 3 stay),
 *  2. the service worker answers a 404'd hashed bundle with the CURRENT
 *     build's file of the same family,
 *  3. reference-data endpoints carry HTTP cache headers (pinned api-side
 *     in settings.routes.test.js).
