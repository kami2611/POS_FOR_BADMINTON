/*
 * This repository is public, and carries no customer's brand.
 *
 * White-label builds are produced in the private build repository: it checks
 * this one out at a tag, applies a brand on top and publishes the installer.
 * The pipeline that does it - brand-build.js, the brands/ packs, the
 * build-desktop workflow - lives there, so a public repository does not also
 * document how customer installers are made.
 *
 * Two things follow, and this file holds both of them.
 *
 * No customer artwork or name may be committed here. A branded seed was
 * committed once already, by a `git add -A` after a client build, and then a
 * stock installer shipped showing that client's logo on its sign-in screen. It
 * was found by the person who installed it.
 *
 * And the runtime hooks stay. A brand reaches a shop either as a seed the build
 * repo drops into resources/brand-seed, or from the gateway through
 * refreshBrand(). Deleting either would quietly break white-labelling for
 * shops that already pay for it, and it would break at their counter rather
 * than here.
