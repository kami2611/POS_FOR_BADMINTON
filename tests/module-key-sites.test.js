/*
 * Module-key wiring guard, strict edition (MODULE_SYSTEM_ROADMAP M5).
 *
 * The companion guard (module-toggle-persistence.test.js) checks one seam in
 * one direction: keys the client sends are keys the server persists. This one
 * starts from the server's own key list - setting.model moduleToggleMap, the
 * single shared truth - and walks every client site a key must be wired
 * through, because each miss has shipped as its own silent field bug:
 *
 *   - a key missing from a generalSettings localStorage blob builder falls
 *     back to default-ON everywhere the cached blob is read (the Cash Book
 *     bug, 11ee85f: gate read the blob, blob never carried the key);
 *   - a key missing from the updateCommonSettings payload is never saved, so
 *     a refresh restores the default (the switched-everything-off-and-back
 *     bug, ede3f1f);
 *   - a checkbox key whose control id is absent from settings_write.html is
 *     WORSE than unsaved: $('#missing').is(':checked') is false, so saving
 *     any other setting silently switches that module OFF (the d1446f8
 *     lesson - a control removed from the DOM resets its setting on save);
 *   - a key missing from _moduleToggleIds is dropped from the M4 remote
 *     branch save, so editing another branch's modules quietly skips it.
