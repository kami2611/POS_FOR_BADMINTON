/*
 * The AI switch, end to end, because a switch has four places to die.
 *
 * The owner opened the Features list looking for AI and it was not there. The
 * page had been built, the button had been built, and the one control a
 * shopkeeper actually looks for had not - so the feature was invisible and
 * unreachable, which is the same as absent.
 *
 * Putting the card back is not enough on its own. A feature switch in this
 * codebase has to exist in four places at once, and missing any one of them
 * produces a control that looks right and does nothing:
 *
 *   1. a card in the Features list, so somebody can find it
 *   2. the id in _moduleToggleIds, or the save never reads the checkbox
 *   3. the key in the server's TOGGLES allowlist, or the save is dropped
 *   4. the key in the FEATURES settings group, or nothing can read it back
 *
 * The third is the quiet one: the endpoint accepts the request, answers
 * success, and discards the key. That is a switch that flips in the browser,
 * says "Features saved", and means nothing.
