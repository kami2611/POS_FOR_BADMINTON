/*
 * Applying an update when the shop closes the till, and the ordering that makes
 * it safe.
 *
 * This is the pattern every desktop application people already trust uses:
 * download quietly, apply on the next close. It suits a till better than it
 * suits a browser - a shop closes at the end of the day anyway, so the restart
 * costs nothing, and the one moment an update must never interrupt is the one
 * moment this cannot fire.
 *
 * electron-updater has autoInstallOnAppQuit for exactly this and it is
 * deliberately not used. Its quit handler bypasses quitAndInstall(), and with
 * it the forced backup that runs before an update is applied. The sequencing is
 * done here instead, and the order is the thing worth protecting: the backup
 * has to happen while the database is still running. Afterwards it would fail,
 * or - worse - appear to succeed and hold nothing.
