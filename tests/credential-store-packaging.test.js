/*
 * credentials-store.js is required from both sides of the asar boundary, and a
 * file cannot live on both. This is not obvious from reading the source, and
 * getting it wrong fails in two different invisible ways.
 *
 * setup-mongodb.js and the API's install.service.js are extraResources - they
 * run from resources/, outside the archive - and require the store by a
 * relative path. main.js is inside the asar and requires it too. Listing it in
 * build.files as well as extraResources does not put it in both places:
 * electron-builder drops a file from the archive when extraResources already
 * copies it, so main.js is left requiring something that is not there. Listing
 * it in build.files alone breaks the other two, and that failure is silent -
 * install.service.js catches it and writes the password in plain text, which is
 * exactly what this whole change exists to stop.
 *
 * So it ships once, in resources/, and main.js reaches it by absolute path.
 *
 * check-packaged-modules.js does not catch either mistake: it walks requires
 * from the asar entry point, and cannot follow a path built at run time.
