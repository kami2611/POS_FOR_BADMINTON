/**
 * Each channel gets its own settings page, named the way a shopkeeper names it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS EXISTS FOR.
 *
 * The Features page was split into one card per channel - Online Ordering,
 * Kiosk Machine, Delivery Partners, Webshop - and shipped. The settings behind
 * those cards were not. All five cards pointed at the same old `#/settings/kiosk`
 * page, still headed "Sales Channels", and the code said so out loud:
 *
 *     All five point at the one channels page for now.
 *     The Features page is split; the settings pages behind it are not, yet.
 *
 * Which is honest, and completely invisible from the outside. The owner opened
 * the console, saw the same combined page he had asked us to take apart, and
 * had no way to tell a half-finished split from a deploy that had not landed.
 * A comment is not a signal; a failing test is.
 *
 * So this pins the finished shape: every channel has its own pane, its own
 * sidebar entry, its own module gate, and no two of them share a page. It also
 * pins the wipe guard that the split made necessary.
