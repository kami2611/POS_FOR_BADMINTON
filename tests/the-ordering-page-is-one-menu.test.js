 *
 * Driving both pages showed it was worse than a missing button. The public
 * menu drew fourteen sections and every dish in the shop. The page people
 * actually ORDER from drew one category at a time, opening on whichever
 * sorted first - so a guest at table 34 of a restaurant opened it, read
 * "32 dishes", and saw a single A5 ruled notebook with 85% of the screen
 * blank. The food was behind a chip strip whose second chip was already cut
 * off by the edge of the phone.
 *
 * After: fourteen sections, thirty-two cards, same page, same request.
 *
 * What this file guards is the thing that made it possible to ship the bug in
 * the first place: none of it fails. A page showing one category out of
 * fourteen renders perfectly, throws nothing, and passes every test that asks
 * whether a card is drawn correctly. The only way to catch it is to assert
 * that the page draws SECTIONS, and that a chip moves you rather than
 * replacing what you are looking at.
