/*
 * The two offscreen windows that render for the printer, and why they differ.
 *
 * Both have been flagged by automated review as "webSecurity: false - fix it".
 * One of them should be fixed and now is. The other must not be, and turning it
 * on would not fail a test or raise an error - it would print receipts with no
 * stylesheet and no shop logo, found by a customer rather than by CI.
 *
 * So the difference is asserted here, in both directions:
 *
 *   - The kitchen ticket window keeps web security ON, and its HTML must stay
 *     self-contained for that to remain true. A logo added to a KOT ticket
 *     would silently stop loading.
 *   - The receipt window keeps it OFF, because the invoice HTML links a
 *     stylesheet and an image from the local API into a data: URL page, whose
 *     origin is opaque.
 *
 * Both are confined the same way regardless, because neither should ever open a
 * window or navigate.
