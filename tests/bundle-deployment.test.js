/**
 * What the API serves has to be what the deploys ship.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR, WHICH RAN FOR THE WHOLE LIFE OF THE FEATURE.
 *
 * `api/app.js` mounts the customer bundles from `path.join(__dirname, '..',
 * 'menu')` and `'../order'`, each behind `fs.existsSync`. Neither deploy
 * workflow ever rsynced those directories - production shipped `api/` alone,
 * develop shipped `api/`, `frontend/public/` and `languages/`.
 *
 * So the guard did what it was written to do and skipped the mount. No error,
 * no warning, nothing in a log. Every `/menu` and every `/order` URL answered
 * 404 on every environment from the day the feature shipped, and a 404 reads
 * as a routing bug rather than a deployment one - which is why it survived
 * review, survived a release, and was found by curling the live site rather
 * than by anything in this suite.
 *
 * The lesson is not "remember the rsync". It is that a directory the code
 * serves and the deploy does not ship is a pair that has to be checked
 * together, in both directions, by something that runs on every pull request.
