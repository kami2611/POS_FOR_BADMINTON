 * The paper says where the order came from.

 * or qr those i want. in the bill also specify. keep this as configurable
 * whether client wants to print in kot or not."
 *
 * The kitchen ticket LOG has said this on screen for a while. A cook holding
 * the paper could not see it, and on a floor with handsets, a QR code and two
 * aggregators, "who sent this" is the question a disputed ticket turns on.
 *
 * TWO COPIES OF ONE TABLE, ON PURPOSE. The ticket is drawn in the desktop shell
 * and the bill payload is built in the API, and those two cannot share a module:
 * the API ships OUTSIDE the asar archive as extraResources/server.js while
 * src/ lives inside it, so a require resolves to a second copy or to nothing.
 * That is the same reason kot-notify.js uses `process` as its bus. So the table
 * is written twice and this file compares them - two copies that are checked
 * beat one copy that cannot be reached.
