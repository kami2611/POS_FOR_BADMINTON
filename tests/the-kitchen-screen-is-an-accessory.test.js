 * The second screen, and the rules it must never break.
 *
 * Owner: "as of now one screen. but we have option multiple screen is good. we
 * should able get control of it ans show it." And: "make everthing
 * configurable pleaes... dont make everthing fixed."
 *
 * So the till drives as many screens as the machine has, each configured on its
 * own. What is pinned here is not how a ticket looks - that is taste and will
 * change - but the four things that would make a shop switch the feature off,
 * in the order of how badly they hurt:
 *
 *   1. THE TILL KEEPS SELLING. Nothing about a second display may throw into
 *      the boot chain. A kitchen screen is an accessory; the till is the shop.
 *   2. IT NEVER STEALS FOCUS. A waiter typing an order into a window that just
 *      lost focus is how this gets switched off in week one.
 *   3. ABSENT MEANS OFF. A shop with a projector or a customer-facing screen
 *      must not suddenly start showing kitchen tickets on it.
 *   4. IT COMES BACK BY ITSELF. A screen needing somebody to click "open
 *      kitchen display" after every power cut will be dark by Thursday.
