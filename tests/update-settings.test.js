/*
 * Two promises the Updates screen makes, and the ways they were not kept.
 *
 * "Check for updates automatically" is a setting a shop turns off for a
 * reason - a metered connection, a machine that must not change during a busy
 * week, an installation someone else supports. UpdateService honoured it. The
 * Updates window did not: it checked on open and then every thirty seconds
 * whatever the setting said. A setting that is quietly ignored is worse than no
 * setting at all, because it is believed.
 *
 * "Go back" existed only as a menu item under a menu a shopkeeper never opens,
 * which is the wrong place for the one action wanted at the moment an update
 * has gone wrong.
 *
 * These are asserted against the source rather than a running window because
 * the failure is structural - a missing guard, a missing control - and that is
 * visible without a browser.
