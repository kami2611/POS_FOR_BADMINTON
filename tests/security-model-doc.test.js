 * The security model is a promise, so it has to stay true.

 * administrator rights or code running as the till's own user can reach the
 * data regardless. That last part is uncomfortable to write down and worth
 * writing down anyway - a business assessing this software deserves to know it
 * rather than discover it.
 *
 * These tests check the claims that are checkable. A promise nothing verifies
