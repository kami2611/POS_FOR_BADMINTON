 * Language handling in the frontend.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-01: "okay start with tamil."
 *
 * What is pinned here is the shape that made a third language impossible, so
 * it cannot come back:
 *
 *   - the current language was identified by a PAGE FILENAME
 *     ('ta_dashboard.html') compared as a literal in 63 places across 15
 *     files, which is a two-way branch with no room for a third arm;
 *   - the words themselves lived in JavaScript, where no translator could
 *     reach them - and where nine Tamil strings in sales.js had been corrupted
 *     into mojibake and shipped to the sale screen.
 *
 * See Intranet docs/MULTI_LANGUAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md for the full path.
