/*
 * The Windows assumptions that shipped to macOS and Linux.
 *
 * Two of them reached a real machine on the same day, both at the worst
 * possible moment - in front of a client:
 *
 *   macOS  "Posnic is damaged and can't be opened."
 *   Ubuntu  a failure naming 7za.exe, on a machine with no .exe files at all.
 *
 * Neither is a mystery once seen. Every build shipped
 * node_modules/7zip-bin/win/x64/7za.exe as tools/7za.exe and server.js asked
 * for that name unconditionally, so the first launch after install failed
 * while extracting the API runtime. And the mac build was signed by nothing at
 * all, which on Apple Silicon is not "unidentified developer" - it is refused
 * outright, and the right-click-Open advice on the download page cannot help,
 * because that escape hatch exists only for apps signed by somebody untrusted.
 *
 * The pattern behind both: this was written on Windows, tested on Windows, and
 * the other two platforms were assumed to follow. These tests are the check
 * that runs on every push, on a Linux runner, whether or not anyone remembers.
