 * The maintenance tools live in the shell, and have to keep living there.
 *
 * Every one of them is for the case where the app itself is misbehaving - a
 * stuck cache, a window dragged onto a screen that is no longer attached, a log
 * somebody needs to send. A page inside the app cannot be relied upon to open
 * at exactly the moment these are wanted, so if one of these ever migrates into
 * the SPA it stops being a maintenance tool and becomes another thing that
 * breaks when the app breaks.
 *
 * main.js is not requireable outside Electron, so this reads it - which is
 * enough to hold the arrangement and to catch a handler wired to nothing.
