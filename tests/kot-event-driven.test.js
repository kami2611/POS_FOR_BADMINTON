/*
 * KOT tickets print on an event now, not on a timer.
 *
 * The API is require()d into the desktop app's main process, so the code that
 * saves a kitchen sale and the code that prints it already share memory. They
 * used to talk over HTTP every five seconds, which is why that screen asked for
 * a Branch ID: a poller is an outsider and has to say whose tickets it wants.
 *
 * The trap this file exists for: the two halves CANNOT import the same module.
 * The API ships outside the ASAR archive (extraResources/server.js) while
 * kot-manager.js lives inside it, so a shared constant would quietly become two
 * constants. The event name is therefore a string literal in both files, and a
 * typo on either side fails silently - tickets simply never print, and nobody
 * finds out until service. So the names are compared here directly.
