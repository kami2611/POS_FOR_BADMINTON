/*
 * Serving a print document from a real origin instead of a data: URL.
 *
 * The receipt window loaded its HTML as `data:text/html;...`, whose origin is
 * opaque, while the invoice markup links print.css and the shop's logo from the
 * local API. An opaque origin may not fetch either, so that window ran with web
 * security disabled - correct for printing, and flagged by every audit.
 *
 * Serving the document from the API makes the page same-origin with both, so
 * the exception is not needed. What has to hold for that to be safe:
 *
 *   - a document is fetched once and is then gone
 *   - nothing off this machine can fetch one
 *   - a document that is never collected does not sit in memory
 *   - and the print window must never gain a preload, because its origin is now
 *     loopback, which ipc-guard trusts
 *
 * That last one is the trade this change makes. It is cheap and correct while
 * the window has no preload, and it silently stops being either if one is added.
