/*
 * The quotes master-detail: one surface, and only the document changes.
 *
 * Two bugs are pinned here, both reported from the live till.
 *
 * 1. FLICKER. showDetails() ran the whole page-entry ritual on every row
 *    click. #quotes_new itself carries the class .page_loader, so
 *    $('.page_loader').hide() tore down the very list being clicked in, and
 *    the next line built it back. Re-entering a page you are already on also
 *    throws away the rail's scroll position and restarts its transitions.
 *    Entering the page and moving between quotes are different operations;
 *    only the first may touch the page chrome.
 *
 * 2. THE EDITOR SHARES THE CONTENTBAR. It is a third child of the same
 *    element the split lays out, so "is the split on?" is not enough to
 *    decide a click is safe to fast-path, and the editor must switch the
 *    split off or it inherits the rail's border and a flex width it never
 *    asked for.
 *
 * The list assertions cover the joined look itself - two cards with a gap
 * between them was the thing being replaced - and the pager, which existed
 * but rendered only past page one, so on a shop with eight quotes it looked
 * like paging had never been built.
