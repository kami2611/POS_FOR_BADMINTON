/*
 * Changing which trade a shop's sample data comes from.
 *
 * Owner: "Demo data user should able to change the industry and install the
 * different data. so keep dedicated page for that."
 *
 * WHAT WAS ACTUALLY WRONG
 *
 * A shop signs up in about thirty seconds. It either picks a trade from a short
 * list or does not pick one at all, and a shop that does not pick is given the
 * supermarket set - which is the right default and the wrong catalogue for a
 * bakery. That bakery then opens its till for the first time and finds
 * twenty-four grocery lines. It is the first thing they see of the product, and
 * until now the only way out was deleting the samples one at a time.
 *
 * The dangerous half is not the chooser. It is that swapping trades DELETES
 * rows, and some of those rows are no longer samples: a shop edits a sample
 * into a real product, or sells one. The purge already refuses both and reports
 * what it kept; these tests hold that behaviour in place and hold the ordering
 * that makes it work.
