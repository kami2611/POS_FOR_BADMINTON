/*
 * The till notices when a handset cannot reach it.
 *
 * Asked for directly, after a morning spent working out why a phone could not
 * open http://<the till>:5555/api while the till itself could: "desktop app
 * can identify this and ask owner to change if its windows and captain app
 * enabled ?"
 *
 * It can, and the reason it is worth doing is that this failure is completely
 * silent. Windows Firewall does not refuse a blocked connection, it drops it.
 * The handset shows an empty table list. The till shows a working screen. No
 * log anywhere records a packet that never arrived. From the shop floor it is
 * indistinguishable from a dead router, and the usual response - reinstall the
 * app - changes nothing, because the app was never the problem.
 *
 * THE SHAPE OF THE BUG, taken off the owner's own machine rather than imagined:
 *
 *   Program                                          Dir     Act   Profile
 *   ...\programs\posnic\posnic.exe                   Inbound Allow Public
 *   ...\programs\posnic\posnic.exe                   Inbound Allow Public
 *
 * Two Allow rules, both scoped to Public, because both were created while the
 * machine sat on a phone hotspot - and Windows writes the rule for whichever
 * profile it happens to be on when the prompt is answered. That till works
 * today. The day it joins a network Windows calls Private, which is what
 * happens the moment anybody answers Yes to "make this PC discoverable", every
 * handset in the shop goes dark and nothing on screen changes.
 *
 * So the test that matters most here is the third one.
