/*
 * A restart must not reprint what already printed.
 *
 * THE BUG, EXACTLY.
 *
 * kot-manager kept its record of printed tickets in `new Set()`, which lives in
 * memory. The only other guard is the server's "marked printed" flag, and that
 * is written AFTER the paper, in a separate request, for the whole batch.
 *
 * Print six tickets, crash before the request, restart. The Set is empty and
 * the server still says unprinted. All six print again. The kitchen cooks
 * twelve dishes and nobody notices, because a cook prepares what arrives and
 * does not compare it with what arrived a minute ago.
 *
 * Owner: "dupliate prints should not be there its loss for company. people wont
 * care and keep preparing what receied. they dont compare usaully what
 * received. so very carefull on that."
 *
 * THE FIX IS DELIBERATELY SMALL. A durable record, written BEFORE the paper,
 * consulted before printing. It does not retry, does not decide anything else,
 * and does not change when the server is told. Printing behaves exactly as it
 * did except that a restart no longer reprints.
 *
 * Written before rather than after because the record has to survive the thing
 * it protects against, and that thing is dying halfway. The cost is that a
 * ticket lost to a crash stays lost until a person notices - the trade argued
 * in Intranet/docs/PRINT_APPROVAL_NOTIFICATION_ARCHITECTURE.md, and the one the
 * owner asked for: a duplicate is silent and costs food, a miss is loud and
 * costs a reminder.
