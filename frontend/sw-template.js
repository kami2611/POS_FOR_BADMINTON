/*
 * Posnic service worker - TEMPLATE. The build (gulpfile.js/sw.js) writes the
 * real public/sw.js from this file, stamping __BUILD_HASH__ with a digest of
 * the built bundles. Do not edit public/sw.js by hand.
 *
 * The invalidation contract (the part that matters):
 *  - The cache name carries the build hash. A server deploy changes this
 *    file's bytes; the browser's own service-worker update check (on every
 *    navigation) installs the new worker, and activate() below deletes every
 *    cache from previous builds. Heavy bundles (script/dashboard.js is the
 *    big one) are served instantly from cache, yet can never survive an
 *    update - exactly the versioned-cache pattern Workbox precaching uses.
 *  - Only same-origin STATIC assets are ever cached. Pages and every /api
 *    request always go to the network: a till must never see a stale price,
 *    sale, or permission because of a cache.
 *  - The desktop shell never registers this worker (its assets are local
 *    files owned by the installer/asset-updater); this is for web and LAN
 *    counter clients, where the 10MB bundle otherwise crosses the wire on
 *    every hard load.
