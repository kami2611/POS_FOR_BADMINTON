 * The languages this build ships.
 *
 * Adding one is this list plus languages/<code>.json, and nothing else: no
 * per-language pages, no branches in the modules, no markup to edit. The
 * switcher in the header is rendered from this at runtime, which is what
 * stops a new language needing a hand-written <a> tag the way Tamil did.
 *
 * `name` is written in the language itself - a Tamil speaker looking for their
 * language is looking for "தமிழ்", not for "Tamil". `flag` is the icon suffix
 * the header already uses. `dir: 'rtl'` marks a right-to-left script; the
 * runtime also derives direction from the code, so this is for the menu and
 * for anything that reads index.json without the runtime.
 *
 * `reviewed` says whether somebody who speaks the language has read the pack
 * on a real screen. EVERY language ships either way - owner's call,
 * 2026-09-02: a shopkeeper who can read their screen in their own language,
 * even imperfectly, is better off than one reading none of it; every missing
 * key still shows English; and a language nobody can see is a language nobody
 * will ever correct. What the flag changes is honesty, not availability: an
 * unreviewed language is marked "beta" in the menu, its coverage is published
 * beside it, and docs/TRANSLATING.md asks speakers to review exactly those
 * first. Flip it to true when a speaker has been through the common screens.
 *
 * POSNIC_REVIEWED_LANGUAGES_ONLY=1 builds with just the reviewed ones, for an
 * installer that wants the older, narrower menu.
