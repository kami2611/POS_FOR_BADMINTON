/*
 * Where a signup came from, inside our own estate.
 *
 * Owner: "letsay create new account comes from demo.posnic.com send utm source
 * as demo or something else. within our eco system i want to know where its
 * comes from. if user comes desktop app then name that too."
 *
 * Every link out to signup used to be the bare URL, so a person who spent ten
 * minutes in the public demo and then signed up was indistinguishable from
 * someone who typed the address - both landed as "direct". The one channel we
 * fully control was the one we could not measure.
 *
 * WHAT NAMES THE SOURCE
 *
 * runtime-info, which the application already publishes and which already
 * knows the answer:
 *
 *   demo: true      the public demo          -> posnic_demo
 *   mode: desktop   the Electron till        -> posnic_desktop
 *   mode: cloud     a real shop, signed in   -> posnic_app
 *   mode: local     community self-hosted    -> posnic_selfhosted
 *
 * Derived rather than hardcoded per page, because a build flag or a user-agent
 * sniff is a second answer to a question the runtime already answers - and the
 * two drift the first time somebody packages the app differently.
 *
 * The demo also carries WHICH COUNTRY's demo it was, taken from the cookie the
 * demo routing sets. "They came from the UAE demo" is a different fact from
 * "they came from the demo", and it is the one that says whether the localized
 * shops are earning their keep.
