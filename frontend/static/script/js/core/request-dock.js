 *
 * And before that: "when i asked cancel, deskto didnt show anthing."
 *
 * WHY A DOCK AND NOT A PAGE. The queue already exists and is good - it shows
 * the dish-level difference a customer asked for, "2 to 3 Chicken Biryani",
 * which is a decision somebody can make at a glance. Its problem is that it
 * is a PAGE. A till is on the sale screen with a queue of people in front of
 * it, and a request that needs answering in the next two minutes cannot live
 * behind a navigation. So it comes to them: bottom right, above everything,
 * on every screen, the way a chat window does.
 *
 * HOW LONG AGO, because that is the whole decision. "Cancel this?" is a
 * different question at forty seconds and at eleven minutes - one the kitchen
 * has not started, the other it has plated - and a timestamp makes a person
 * do that arithmetic under pressure. The card says "ordered 11 minutes ago"
 * and updates itself while it sits open.
 *
 * IT DECIDES NOTHING OF ITS OWN. Accept and refuse go through the same
 * endpoint the queue page uses, so there is one implementation of what
 * accepting a cancellation means; this is a second door onto it, not a second
 * copy of it.
