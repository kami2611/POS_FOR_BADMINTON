/*
 * A filter bar for any data list.
 *
 * Written once because it is going on every list - quotes, items, sales,
 * purchases. The alternative is the same bar copied five times, and this
 * codebase has already paid for that twice today: a helper that existed as
 * five copies, where each fix only ever landed in whichever copy bit that week.
 *
 * What it owns:
 *   - a Filter button that lives in the PAGE HEADER, next to New, and says how
 *     many filters are active. The panel is closed by default: a list is for
 *     reading, and a bar that is always open spends height on controls nobody
 *     is using yet.
 *   - a compact search box with a "which field" selector and an Exact toggle.
 *     Exact narrows the ANSWER, not the cost. It is worth being precise about
 *     this: the server builds /^term$/i, and MongoDB can only use a prefix
 *     index for a case-SENSITIVE regex, so an exact search scans the branch's
 *     rows exactly as a fragment search does. What it buys is one right answer
 *     instead of every row containing the text - which is the whole point when
 *     a name has been picked from a list.
 *   - a date range with the presets people actually pick, carrying real times
 *     rather than bare dates.
 *   - an optional typeahead per field, so choosing "Customer" offers the
 *     customers this till actually uses instead of demanding exact spelling.
 *
 * What each list supplies: its fields, whether it has a date, and what to do
 * when the filter changes. Nothing in here knows what a quote is.
