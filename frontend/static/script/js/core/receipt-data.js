/*
 * Read a receipt back out of the HTML that was about to be printed.
 *
 * The desktop app prints receipts as ESC/POS rather than as a page, which needs
 * the sale as data, not as markup. Every caller of printView already builds the
 * receipt into .print-modal-body and hands over its HTML, and there are
 * seventeen of them, so rather than change all seventeen this reads the values
 * back out of that markup.
 *
 * That sounds fragile and would be, except the markup is not incidental: it is
 * the shop's configured receipt template (branch.thermal_body_print), whose
 * class names are the contract between the template and the code that fills it
 * in. sales_view.js writes into .invoice-content-heading and .item-total; this
 * reads from the same places.
 *
 * Reading the rendered receipt has one property that passing a sale object
 * would not: whatever the shop turned off in Config is already gone. The
 * visibility toggles run before the HTML is taken, and they use jQuery's
 * hide(), which writes an inline display:none. So the extractor drops hidden
 * elements and inherits every print setting for free, including settings added
 * after this was written.

 * ------------------------------------------------------------- THE LOGO

 * dot, packed eight to a byte, as a GS v 0 raster command.
 *
 * So this is where the logo has to be prepared, not in the renderer. The
 * main process has no canvas, no image decoder and no idea what a PNG is;
 * the page that is about to print has all three, and already has the logo
 * on screen, decoded, in the print modal. Reported from a shop in Italy who
 * had Print Logo enabled and no logo on their roll - there was no code to
 * put one there.
 *
 * Dots, not pixels. A receipt printer is 203dpi, which is 8 dots per mm, so
 * the printable width is 576 dots at 80mm (72mm of paper) and 384 at 58mm
 * (48mm). Those are the same numbers as PosnicPro.PAPER.content, and the
 * same 12 dots per character that makes 48 and 32 columns.
