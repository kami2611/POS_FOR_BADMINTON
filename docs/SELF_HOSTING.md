# Running Posnic on your own server

Posnic normally runs as a desktop application on the shop computer. It can also
run on a server, so staff use it from a browser on any till, tablet or phone on
the network.

Both are the same free software under AGPL-3.0. Nothing here is a trial and
nothing expires.

## Which one do you want?

|                             | Desktop          | Your own server                         |
| --------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Install                     | Download and run | One command on Ubuntu                   |
| Where the data lives        | That computer    | Your server                             |
| Works with no internet      | Yes              | On your own network, yes                |
| Several people at once      | One computer     | Any device that can reach the server    |
| Somebody must maintain it   | No               | **You** — updates, backups, certificate |
| Sync between separate shops | Posnic Cloud     | Posnic Cloud                            |

**Be honest with yourself about the last two rows.** A server is not a better
desktop; it is a machine somebody has to look after. If one person rings up
sales on one computer, the desktop edition is the right answer and always will
be.

### What self-hosting does not include

**Sync between tills or branches is not part of this.** That is
[Posnic Cloud](https://www.posnic.com/pricing.html), and it is a paid service.

A self-hosted Posnic is **one database that several people use at once**, which
is what most single-shop setups actually want. It is not several databases kept
in step with each other. If you need two shops to see each other's stock, you
need Cloud.

Off-site backups, the remote dashboard and installers under your own brand are
also Cloud.

---

## What you need

- **Ubuntu 24.04.** The installer refuses to guess on anything else. Other
  systems are possible by hand — see [By hand](#by-hand).
- **2 GB of memory.** A fresh install uses about 600 MB with MongoDB running,
  so 1 GB leaves nothing for a busy day or an upgrade.
- **8 GB of disk**, more if you keep years of sales.
- A domain name, if the server is reachable from the internet.

A 2 GB virtual machine from any provider is enough for a single shop. That is
around $10–12 a month at the time of writing.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Posnic/POS/develop/scripts/install-server.sh -o install-server.sh
less install-server.sh          # read it first - you are about to run it as root
sudo bash install-server.sh
```

It installs Node.js 22, MongoDB 8, and Posnic into `/opt/posnic`, generates
this machine's own secrets, and runs it under systemd so it comes back after a
reboot.

When it finishes it prints the address to open. The setup wizard creates your
shop and your first user.

Re-running it updates Posnic to the latest release and **leaves your secrets
and your data alone**.

### What it changes

Worth knowing before you run something as root:

|                  |                                                     |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Installs         | `nodejs`, `mongodb-org`, `git`, `curl`, `gnupg`     |
| Adds apt sources | NodeSource, MongoDB                                 |
| Creates          | `/opt/posnic`, `/etc/systemd/system/posnic.service` |
| Starts           | `mongod` and `posnic`, both enabled at boot         |
| Never touches    | an existing `api/.env`, or your database            |

---

## Three things to do afterwards

The installer says this too, because none of them are optional on a shop that
takes real money.

### 1. A certificate

Straight after install, Posnic answers plain HTTP on port 3000. **Passwords
cross the network in the clear.** On a private LAN that is a risk you might
accept; on the internet it is not.

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

`/etc/nginx/sites-available/posnic`:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name pos.example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_read_timeout 300s;
    }
}
```

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/posnic /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d pos.example.com
```

certbot installs the certificate, redirects HTTP to HTTPS, and renews it on a
timer.

### 2. A firewall

```bash
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
sudo ufw enable
```

**Port 27017 must never be open to the internet.** An exposed MongoDB is found
by scanners within hours, and Posnic only needs it on `127.0.0.1`.

### 3. Backups

Your shop's records are in MongoDB on that one disk. A server does not back
itself up, and a snapshot of the whole machine taken once a month is not a
backup of yesterday's takings.

`/etc/cron.d/posnic-backup`:

```cron
0 2 * * * root mongodump --db Posnic --archive=/var/backups/posnic-$(date +\%F).gz --gzip && find /var/backups -name 'posnic-*.gz' -mtime +14 -delete
```

Then **copy them somewhere else**. A backup on the same disk as the database
survives a mistake but not a dead machine.

And restore one, once, before you need to:

```bash
mongorestore --drop --archive=/var/backups/posnic-2026-09-02.gz --gzip
```

A backup nobody has restored is a file, not a backup.

---

## Running it

```bash
systemctl status posnic          # is it up
journalctl -u posnic -f          # what it is doing
sudo systemctl restart posnic    # after changing api/.env
sudo bash install-server.sh      # update to the latest release
```

Posnic lives in `/opt/posnic`, its settings in `/opt/posnic/api/.env`, and its
data in MongoDB under the database named in `MONGODB_URI`.

### If it will not start

```bash
journalctl -u posnic -n 50 --no-pager
```

The two usual causes:

- **`refusing to start; these are not set`** — `api/.env` is missing or
  incomplete. Delete it and re-run the installer to regenerate it. Note this
  signs everybody out.
- **MongoDB is not running** — `systemctl status mongod`.

---

## By hand

On a system the installer will not touch, the shape is:

1. Node.js 22 and MongoDB 8, both running.
2. `git clone https://github.com/Posnic/POS.git`
3. `npm --prefix api install --omit=dev`
4. `cd frontend && npm install && npx gulp build`
5. Write `api/.env` with `JWT_SECRET`, `SESSION_SECRET`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`
   (16 random bytes as hex), `ENCRYPTION_IV` (8 bytes as hex), `POSNIC_KEY`,
   `POSNIC_SECRET`, `MONGODB_URI` and `PORT`.
6. Run `node api/server.js` under whatever supervises processes on your system.

The API serves the built frontend itself, so there is no second web server to
configure — only the reverse proxy that terminates TLS.

`scripts/install-server.sh` is the readable version of all of this.

## If you are locked out

For Community installations, first use **Recover with an offline code** on
the sign-in page. The owner saves these codes during setup, or generates them
from **Profile → Account recovery** while signed in. Recovery needs only your
local server, without email or internet. See [Offline account recovery](COMMUNITY_RECOVERY.md).

If nobody can sign in and no codes are available, the server administrator can
use the command below for an installation run from this repository. It requires
access to that server's database credentials; it is not a remote reset service
or a command for the packaged desktop app.

Run this **on the server itself**:

```bash
cd /opt/posnic
npm run recover
```

It lists everyone who can sign in, and — usefully when somebody says _"it
worked yesterday"_ — when each password was last changed.

To set one:

```bash
npm run recover -- owner@yourshop.example 'a new password'
```

Three things worth knowing:

- It hashes the password the way this application expects. Editing the database
  by hand almost always gets this wrong, and the symptom is nasty: sign-in
  works, and manager approvals quietly stop accepting the same password weeks
  later.
- **Every use is written to your own audit log**, with the operating-system
  account that ran it. You can see it happened.
- It only opens the database this installation already uses. There is no flag
  to point it somewhere else.

The command revokes the account's previous sessions, sign-in tokens, email reset
links and offline recovery codes. After signing in, generate and save new codes.

This is not a back door. Anybody who can run it can already read your database
directly — they are sitting on your server. What it does is make recovery
documented and recorded, instead of a technique somebody has to know.

## Questions people ask

**Can I move from desktop to server later?** Yes. Both use the same database
format; `mongodump` on one and `mongorestore` on the other.

**Can two shops share one server?** They can each have a database on it, but
they will not see each other's stock or customers, and Posnic will not keep
them in step. That is what Cloud sync is for.

**Do I have to publish my changes?** Posnic is AGPL-3.0. If you modify it and
let other people use it over a network, you must offer them your modified
source. Running it unmodified for your own shop asks nothing of you.

**Can I call my install "Posnic"?** For your own use, yes. Offering it to
others under that name needs permission — the name and logo are trademarks and
are not covered by the AGPL. See [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md#trademark-and-reserved-rights).

**Is this supported?** The software is free and comes with no warranty. Ask in
[issues](https://github.com/Posnic/POS/issues) and somebody may help. Paid
support is part of Cloud.
