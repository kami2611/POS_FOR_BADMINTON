 * accepting it, a ticket coming out of a kitchen printer, the shop refusing
 * it at 2am - happened behind the customer's back, and the only way to find

 * is no ladder of greyed-out future steps, because the steps after "in the
 * kitchen" are not ours to promise - nothing marks an order ready, and a
 * shop whose kitchen printer is off never reports a ticket at all. A ladder
 * would draw three rungs and stop on the first, which reads as "stuck" to a
 * customer whose food is being cooked. See api/src/utils/order-progress.js.

 * HOW OFTEN IT ASKS. Insistently for the first two minutes, then slower, and
 * NOTHING AT ALL while the phone is in a pocket: a screen nobody is looking
 * at has nothing to redraw, and a full restaurant of phones polling from a
 * table would be the entire cost of this feature. It asks once more the
