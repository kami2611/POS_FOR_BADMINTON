/*
 * Where this customer is sitting.
 *
 * A restaurant with nine tables puts a code on each. The hotel across the road
 * puts one in every room, and those orders arrive through the same storefront
 * without being the same orders: the room pays an agreed markup, the hotel is
 * owed a cut of it, and the food has to reach a room number rather than a
 * table. All of that is decided on the server. This file's whole job is to
 * carry the two words the URL said - which venue, which room - from the page
 * the customer landed on to the request that places the order.
 *
 *   /order/AZ100                 the shop
 *   /order/AZ100/table/5         its own table five
 *   /order/AZ100/venue/RC/123    Royal Club Hotel, room 123
 *
 * WHY IT IS STORED AT ALL.
 *
 * The customer lands on the deep URL once and then walks through home.html,
 * products.html, cart.html and payment.html, none of which carry it. Reading
 * the URL on each page would lose the room at the first tap.
 *
 * IN sessionStorage, NOT localStorage. A room number is true for one visit. On
 * a hotel's own tablet, or a phone that scanned a different code last week,
 * localStorage would quietly send tonight's food to last week's room. When the
 * tab closes, this is gone.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS TRUSTED. The page says WHICH venue the printed code named;
 * the server looks up what that venue's markup and commission are. A customer
 * editing this in a console changes which hotel they claim to be in, which the
 * server will price accordingly - not what any hotel charges.
