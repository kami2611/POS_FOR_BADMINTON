/*
 * What this page is allowed to do, and what it tells the customer it cannot.
 *
 * The shop's server decides. `/items/accessQr` answers with an
 * `online_ordering` block saying whether it is taking orders and, if not, why
 * and when it will again. This file stores that answer and applies it to
 * whatever page the customer is looking at.
 *
 * WHY THE PAGE DOES NOT WORK THIS OUT FOR ITSELF.
 *
 * The obvious implementation compares the current time against the shop's
 * opening hours in the browser. That is wrong twice over: a phone's clock can
 * be wrong or set deliberately, and it would put a second copy of the
 * schedule arithmetic somewhere it can drift from the one the order endpoint
 * uses. So the server sends a verdict, not a schedule, and this file renders
 * it.
 *
 * WHY IT FAILS OPEN.
 *
 * With no stored verdict - a first load, a cleared browser, an older server
 * that does not send the block - the page behaves as though ordering is on.
 * The cost of being wrong that way is one refused checkout with a clear
 * message, because `qrOrder` runs the same check again and is the actual
 * control. The cost of failing the other way is every shop silently becoming a
 * menu the moment anything hiccups, which loses orders nobody ever hears
 * about. Open here, closed on the server.
 *
 * HIDING IS DONE IN CSS, NOT BY WALKING THE DOM.
 *
 * Product cards are injected after this runs, and re-running on every render
 * is how a hidden control comes back. A class on <html> and a stylesheet rule
 * covers markup that does not exist yet.
