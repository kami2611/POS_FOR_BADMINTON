/*
 * Talk to order.
 *
 * A microphone beside the assistant's title. Tap it and you talk to the
 * shop's assistant the way you would talk to a waiter, and it talks back.
 *
 * TWO WAYS, ONE CONVERSATION. Where the shop's provider can hold a live
 * line (OpenAI today), the phone opens a WebRTC call straight to it: the
 * customer can interrupt, the reply starts before the sentence is over,
 * and the model calls the page's tools to add or remove things. Where it
 * cannot, the page listens with the phone's own recogniser, asks the
 * typed assistant, and reads the answer aloud with the phone's own voice:
 * a beat slower, no interruptions, no extra cost.
 *
 * WHAT THE MODEL CAN AND CANNOT DO. On the live line it asks for
 * add_to_order, remove_from_order, set_quantity or show_order; the page
 * checks the item is on this menu, applies the change through the same
 * code a tap on "Add" uses (badge, bill bar, chip counts), writes a line
 * into the conversation, and tells the model what happened. The model
 * never touches the order itself. The audio goes phone to provider; our
 * server only opens the line and never hears a word.

   * So this is the door. A second send at the same table, from the phone that
   * placed the first one, ADDS to that order rather than opening a second. It
   * goes through the customer's own change endpoint, which means the shop's
   * rules still decide: inside the window it simply changes, past it the
   * kitchen may have started so it becomes a request the shop answers, and a
   * billed or paid order refuses and this falls through to a fresh ticket -
   * which is correct, because a settled table is a new sitting.
   *

   * WHAT IT COSTS: talking over the assistant no longer interrupts it. In a

   * A restaurant is full of people talking and none of them are ordering from
   * this phone. Turn detection cannot tell them apart: to a voice detector,
   * the next table is speech, and speech is a turn. Raising the threshold
   * only trades one mistake for the other - too high and the customer has to
   * shout, too low and the room orders for them.
   *
   * THE THING THAT ACTUALLY SEPARATES THEM IS DISTANCE. The phone is about
   * forty centimetres from the person holding it and two or three metres from
   * the next table. Sound falls off with the square of the distance, so the
   * person holding it arrives something like thirty times louder. That is an
   * enormous gap - far bigger than the difference between a loud voice and a
   * quiet one, which is all a fixed threshold can see - and it is measurable
   * on any phone with an analyser.
   *
   * So: listen to the room for a moment when the line opens, learn how loud
   * it is when nobody is speaking into the phone, and let audio through only
   * when it is loud enough to be somebody who is. A customer who leans in and
   * talks is heard. The next table is not.
   *
   * AND A BUTTON, WHICH IS THE ONLY COMPLETE ANSWER. Hold it and the line
   * hears you whatever the room is doing. Nothing measured can be perfect;
   * something held is.
   *
   * THREE FACTS, ONE DECISION, so the microphone never has two owners:
   *   speaking  the assistant is talking, and must not hear itself
   *   holding   a thumb is on the button, which overrules everything
   *   near      somebody is speaking close to the phone

   * WHAT THE MICROPHONE IS ASKED FOR.
   *
   * Owner: "ai keep saying ok ok ok. coz may be surrounding sound", and then
   * "i want see mic noise cancellation".
   *
   * This asked for `audio: true`, which is the bare default - a raw
   * microphone with nothing switched on. Every browser can do better, and in
   * a restaurant the difference is the whole feature:
   *
   *   noiseSuppression   the fan, the fridge, the room. Steady sound the
   *                      phone can recognise as not-speech and remove.
   *   echoCancellation   the assistant's OWN voice coming back in through the
   *                      speaker. Without it the line hears itself, decides
   *                      somebody spoke, and answers - which is how a
   *                      conversation talks itself in circles.
   *   autoGainControl    OFF, and this is the one that had to change.
   *
   * WHY AGC HAD TO GO.
   *
   * Owner: "second outside talk is the problem while do live conversation."
   *
   * This page already decides who is talking by DISTANCE: the customer is at
   * arm's length and the next table is three metres away, and sound falls off
   * fast enough that the near one is many times louder. That ratio is what
   * `NEAR_ENOUGH` measures and it is a good discriminator - people cannot be
   * told apart by a microphone, but near and far can.
   *
   * Automatic gain control exists to destroy exactly that ratio. It quietens
   * the loud and lifts the quiet until everything arrives at one level, so
   * the table behind gets amplified up toward the threshold that was meant to
   * exclude them. The feature was fighting its own gate.
   *
   * The cost is real and worth naming: a softly spoken customer in a loud
   * room now arrives quieter at the far end. That is the right trade. A line
   * that mishears a quiet customer asks them to repeat; a line that hears the
   * next table answers a question nobody asked, on the shop's money.
   *
   * ASKED FOR, NOT DEMANDED. These are plain values rather than `{ exact: }`,
   * so a device that cannot do one of them gives what it can instead of
   * refusing the microphone altogether - and a refused microphone is no
   * ordering at all, which is much worse than a noisy one.
   *
   * The channel and rate matter too: one channel at 16kHz is what speech
   * recognition wants, and asking for less than the phone would send by
   * default means less of the room arriving at the far end.
