/*
 * HOW BIG THE TEXT HAS TO BE, AND THEREFORE HOW MUCH FITS.
 *
 * A kitchen screen is read at a distance, by somebody moving, often glancing
 * sideways, through steam, with a knife in hand. Below a certain size the text
 * is not small, it is ABSENT - and a screen showing twenty orders nobody can
 * read is worse than one showing six, because it looks like it is working.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A MODULE AND NOT A STYLESHEET
 *
 * Owner: "around 5 meter." The doc this came from was worked out at 2.5m, and
 * five metres is not "a bit further away", it is a different machine:
 *
 *     distance    font      fits on a 43" 1080p
 *     2.5 m       ~45 px    about 12 orders
 *     5.0 m       ~84 px    about 2
 *
 * Legibility depends on how large a letter is ON THE EYE, so doubling the
 * distance doubles the letter height - and that costs area in BOTH directions.
 * Double the distance, quarter the orders. That is the single most surprising
 * thing about these screens and the reason this is computed rather than
 * guessed at by whoever writes the CSS.
 *
 * So the shop tells us the distance and the screen size, and this says what
 * actually fits. If the answer is two orders, it says two orders - before
 * anybody mounts a television.
 *
 * Owner: "make everthing configurable pleaes... dont make everthing fixed."
 * Every number below has a default and every default can be overridden.
 *
 * THE OPTICS, in one place so they can be argued with
 *
 * Comfortable reading is around 16 minutes of arc; glanceable text across a
 * room wants 20 to 30. This is the same basis as ISO 9241-303 for electronic
 * visual displays and the signage rule of roughly one inch of letter height per
 * twenty feet of viewing distance.
 *
 *     cap height = 2 x distance x tan(angle / 2)
 *
 * Cap height, not font size: font size includes ascenders and descenders that
 * nobody reads a table number by. Sizing to the em box is how the first
 * strikethrough attempt came out two thirds too small.
