 * A logo the PAGE could not read, rasterised where there is no such thing as

 *
 * receipt-data.js prepares the logo in the page, which is the right place: the
 * image is already on screen and already decoded, and it costs nothing. But a
 * page can only read pixels back off a canvas it is allowed to read. An image
 * served from another origin without CORS headers TAINTS the canvas, and
 * `getImageData` throws - so a shop whose logo lives somewhere other than the
 * dashboard got a receipt with no logo and a warning in a console nobody
 * opens.
 *
 * The main process has no origin and no canvas. It has `nativeImage`, which is
 * Chromium's decoder without the browser's rules, so the same picture the page
 * was refused is simply a file here. This is the fallback: the page tries
 * first and hands over a `{ src }` when it cannot, and this turns that into
 * dots.
 *
 * The dithering is deliberately the same algorithm as the page's, not a
 * simpler one. Two paths that print the same logo differently is the kind of
 * difference somebody reports as a printer fault.
