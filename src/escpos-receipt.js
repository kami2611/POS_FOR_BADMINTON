 * Receipts as ESC/POS commands.

 * The desktop app used to print receipts by handing HTML to the Windows
 * driver. That works in a browser because the print dialog quietly scales the
 * page to fit; a silent print has no such rescue, so the layout had to be
 * exactly right and it never was.
 *
 * A thermal printer does not want a page. It wants characters and a handful of
 * control codes, and it has a fixed number of columns:
 *
 *   58mm roll   32 characters   384 dots
 *   80mm roll   48 characters   576 dots
 *
 * Laying out to columns instead of millimetres removes every question about
 * scaling, driver page sizes and CSS. A line either fits in 48 characters or
 * it does not, and that is decidable here rather than on the paper.
 *
 * The browser keeps printing HTML, which is what its users already have.

/*
 * A SYMBOL THE PRINTER DOES NOT HAVE, TAUGHT TO IT.
 *
 * The font has no euro and `ESC t` does nothing here, so for a while the
 * receipt spelled it "EUR". A shop in Italy reading its own totals as
 * "EUR13.00" is correct and looks like a workaround, because it was one.
 *
 * But a thermal printer draws dots, and ESC/POS has a command for exactly
 * this: `ESC &` downloads a bitmap into a character slot and `ESC % 1`
 * switches the user-defined set on, after which that slot prints the bitmap
 * as an ordinary character. One column wide, so none of the 48-column
 * arithmetic below changes - which is the whole reason to do it this way
 * rather than as a raster image, which would break the line.
 *
 * PROVED ON A REAL POS-80C before this shipped, because `ESC t` looked just
 * as standard on paper and turned out to be ignored. The probe that settled
 * it is tests/tools/can-this-printer-learn-a-euro.js, and it checks the part
 * that would be unshippable if it failed: that the printer LEAVES the
 * user-defined set again afterwards. One that stayed in it would garble
 * every receipt after this one.
 *
 * The slot is a backtick: the one printable ASCII character that never
 * legitimately appears on a receipt, so borrowing it costs nothing. Any
 * backtick in a shop's own text is removed before this, so a stray one
 * cannot turn into a currency symbol.
 *
 * A printer that ignores the download prints whatever its ROM has in that
 * slot instead, which is why `symbolGlyphs: false` exists and spells the
 * word again.
