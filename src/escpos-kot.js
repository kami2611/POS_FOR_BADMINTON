/*
 * The kitchen ticket, as bytes.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * The ticket used to be built as HTML, loaded into a hidden BrowserWindow,
 * rendered, converted to PDF and handed to SumatraPDF. Measured end to end on
 * a real till, an order took 2,080 ms to reach paper, and 1,114 ms of that was
 * this one step. A receipt covering the same ground, rendered straight to
 * ESC/POS, took 124 ms.
 *
 * Owner: "prints are very slow. as soon receive order it needs to print...
 * every seconds counts here."
 *
 * So the kitchen ticket is built the way the receipt already is: bytes, sent
 * to the roll. No window, no PDF, no second program. The HTML path stays for
 * anything that is not a thermal roll and as the fallback if this refuses.
 *
 * WHAT THE PAPER SAYS, AND WHY IT IS LAID OUT THIS WAY
 *
 * A cook reads a ticket in this order: what kind of sheet is this, which table,
 * what do I make. So that is the order it prints, and the first two are the
 * only things set large. The serial number is what the pass calls out, so it
 * keeps the biggest type on the sheet.
 *
 * THE CANCELLED LINE IS CROSSED OUT, which is the one thing this path lost
 * when it stopped being HTML. The old page had `text-decoration: line-through`
 * and that was the end of it; ESC/POS has no such command, so for a while the
 * heading carried the whole meaning - "Item Cancelled" at the top, and every
 * line under it cancelled. A cook reading a spike of tickets sideways does not
 * get that. Receipt.strikeLine draws the line as dots, only as wide as the
 * words, and the heading stays because two signals are better than one.
 */
const { Receipt } = require('./escpos-receipt');

/*
 * HOW HOT, ON THE PAPER.
 *
 * The customer taps one, two or three chillies; the ticket says the word and
 * the count. ASCII, because every character on this path goes through
 * Receipt.text -> ascii() -> latin1, and an emoji arrives as a question mark
 * or as nothing at all. The count is not decoration: a cook who does not read
 * English still reads 2 of 3.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT IMPORTED. The same three words live in
 * api/src/utils/spice-level.js, which is where the server decides them, and
 * the desktop shell cannot require across into the API package. Rather than a
 * byte-copy pipeline for eight lines, tests/the-ticket-says-how-hot.test.js
 * runs BOTH implementations over every level and refuses a commit where they
 * disagree - so the drift this would otherwise invite fails a build instead of
 * misreporting somebody's food.
