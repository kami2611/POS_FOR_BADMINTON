/*
 * What this till has already tried to print, remembered across a restart.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR
 *
 * kot-manager kept its record of printed tickets in `new Set()`. A Set lives in
 * memory, so every restart emptied it, and the only other guard - the server's
 * own "marked printed" flag - is written AFTER the paper comes out, in a
 * separate request, for the whole batch at once.
 *
 * Print six tickets, crash before that request, restart. The Set is empty and
 * the server still says unprinted. All six print again, the kitchen cooks twelve
 * dishes, and nobody notices: a cook prepares what arrives and does not compare
 * it against what arrived a minute ago.
 *
 * Owner: "dupliate prints should not be there its loss for company. people wont
 * care and keep preparing what receied. they dont compare usaully what
 * received. so very carefull on that."
 *
 * WHY THE RECORD IS WRITTEN BEFORE THE PRINT
 *
 * The record has to survive the thing it is protecting against, and what it is
 * protecting against is dying halfway. Written afterwards it is useless exactly
 * when it is needed. So the attempt is written first, flushed, and the outcome
 * is added after.
 *
 * That means a till which dies between the write and the paper will NOT reprint
 * that ticket, and someone has to notice a missing one. That is the intended
 * trade, argued in Intranet/docs/PRINT_APPROVAL_NOTIFICATION_ARCHITECTURE.md: a
 * duplicate is silent and costs food, a miss is loud and costs a reminder.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
 *
 * It does not retry, does not decide anything, and does not change when the
 * server is told. Printing behaves exactly as it did except that a restart no
 * longer reprints. Everything else in this area is Stage 2 and is a bigger
 * change with real trade-offs; this is the small safe one that stops the
 * bleeding.
 *
 * It also records the OUTCOME of every attempt, including failures, which is
 * the measurement this area has never had. Nobody currently knows whether
 * duplicates happen four times a week or forty.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE MAY THROW. A ledger problem must never become a printing
 * problem: a customer is standing there and the ticket matters more than the
 * bookkeeping.
