/*
 * The one place that reads and writes .mongodb-credentials.json.
 *
 * Nine files touched that path directly - main.js, setup-mongodb.js,
 * mongodb-manager.js, sync-agent-manager.js, install.service.js - each with its
 * own JSON.parse and its own idea of which candidate directory to look in.
 * Encrypting the password in nine places would have meant nine chances to get
 * the migration wrong, so it happens here instead and the callers ask for
 * credentials rather than for a file.
 *
 * The file used to hold the password in the clear. Now:
 *
 *   { username, password: { v, alg, iv, tag, ct }, enc: 1 }
 *
 * The key lives beside it in .credential-key.json, wrapped by the operating
 * system's keystore where there is one. Deliberately its own file rather than a
 * field in .local-secrets.json: that file is owned by main.js and read during
 * startup, and two writers on one file is a race waiting to happen.
 *
 * Reading tolerates both shapes. An install made before this change has a plain
 * string, which is read as-is and rewritten encrypted the next time anything
 * saves - so the upgrade needs no flag day, no prompt and no migration step
 * that could half-finish.
 *
 * What this is worth, and what it is not, is set out in local-crypto.js. In
 * short: a copied file is dead, casual reading and generic stealers are
 * stopped, and anyone targeting Posnic specifically is not.
