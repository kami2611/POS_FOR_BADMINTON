/*
 * The sound an online order makes.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL.
 *
 * Every other way this product learns about a sale has a person standing in
 * front of it: somebody rings it up, somebody hands over a card. An online
 * order is the one that arrives when the shop is not looking - the owner's
 * words were "looking at another page, or watching a movie" - and a badge on a
 * screen nobody is facing is not a notification, it is a record of something
 * that was missed.
 *
 * TWO SOUNDS, DELIBERATELY DIFFERENT.
 *
 *   received   accepted already, ticket printing. One short chime: this is
 *              information, not a task, and a shop doing forty covers an hour
 *              must not be alarmed forty times.
 *   waiting    held for approval. An alarm, repeated, because until somebody
 *              answers it the customer is waiting and the kitchen does not
 *              know they exist. It stops the moment the queue is empty.
 *
 * One sound for both would train staff to ignore the one that matters, which
 * is how alarms stop working.
 *
 * SYNTHESISED, NOT SHIPPED. The tones are generated as a WAV in memory rather
 * than bundled as audio files: two more binaries in the installer, licences to
 * track and a packaging filter to keep correct, for two beeps. Generating them
 * is a page of arithmetic that cannot rot.
 *
 * NOT A DIALOG. The owner's standing rule is that nothing blocks the screen: a
 * modal that steals focus mid-sale is worse than the missed order it was
 * meant to prevent. This makes a noise and updates a count; acting on it is
 * always the person's choice.
 */

 * fast it dies].
 *
 * AN ENVELOPE THAT DECAYS. A struck thing is loudest the instant it is hit and
 * fades from there. The old tone held full volume throughout and faded at both
 * ends, which is a tone being switched on and off: an appliance, not an
