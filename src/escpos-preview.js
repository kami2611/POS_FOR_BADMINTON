/*
 * ESC/POS bytes, read back.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * The kitchen ticket and the receipt are built as bytes and sent to a roll, and
 * until now the only way to see what a change did to them was to print one. So
 * the questions that come up - did the cancelled line get crossed out, does the
 * table number still fit at double width, what does a 58mm roll do to a long
 * dish name - were answered by walking to a printer, and on a day when the
 * printer was off or its queue was jammed they were not answered at all.
 *
 * This turns a stream of bytes into an ordered list of rows with the styling
 * that was in force when each one printed. From there a test can assert on the
 * layout, and a screen can draw a picture of the paper.
 *
 * IT ONLY UNDERSTANDS WHAT THIS CODEBASE EMITS, deliberately. A general
 * emulator has to guess at a hundred vendor extensions and gets the important
 * ones no more right for it; escpos-receipt.js sends about ten commands, and
 * ten commands can be read exactly. Anything unrecognised is skipped by its own
 * documented length rather than guessed at, so an unknown command shifts the
 * layout rather than corrupting every row after it.

 * so the row reads as the line it prints as, not as the accented letter the
 * same byte means in WPC1252.
