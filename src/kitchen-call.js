 * working kitchen loses its first two words, and the first two words are the
 * table number - the one part nobody can guess from the rest.
 *
 * WHAT IS SAID, AND WHAT IS NOT. Names and counts. Not notes, not the dish's
 * description, not the price. A ticket read aloud for ninety seconds is one a
 * kitchen stops listening to, and what makes announcements fail is never that
 * they said too little.
 *
 * ENGLISH, by the owner's choice: "All english as of now." The one place that
 * decides is `say()` below.
 *
 * PER MACHINE, NOT PER SHOP. Only the machine in the kitchen has the speaker.

 * the kitchen's own speaker is muted too.
