   * more on the next ticket. Three tickets against a sleeping printer is
   * a minute and a half before the poll after it even begins, and every
   * ticket raised in the meantime waits behind it. That is the few
   * minutes, and it compounds exactly when things are already going
   * wrong.
   *
   * And the nudge could start a second pass on top of a running one:
   * _onKotEvent clears the scheduled timer, but a pass that is mid-print
   * has no timer to clear, so the guard guarded nothing. Both passes then
   * asked the server for the same tickets - the server lets a till past
   * its OWN claim on purpose - and raced through the same printer queue.
   * Nothing printed twice, because the ledger holds that line, but the
   * work was doubled at the worst possible moment.
   *
   * So a pass in flight takes a note instead, and the note is honoured
   * the moment the pass ends.

     * HOW LONG IT ACTUALLY TOOK, ON THE SHOP'S OWN COUNTER.
     *
     * The order-to-paper numbers behind this work - 2,080 ms before, 184 ms
     * after - were measured on one developer machine with two virtual
     * printers. That is enough to choose a design and not enough to know what
     * a real kitchen sees, on a real roll, at the end of a long USB extension
     * run down a corridor.
     *
     * Owner: "every seconds counts here." There was no way to answer him with
     * anything but a number from somebody else's laptop.
     *
     * So every ticket records what it cost: per printer, and end to end. The
     * log already exists and already has a screen; it simply never said this.
     * Now a slow shop is a fact somebody can read off Hardware Manager rather
     * than an impression.
     *
     * `via` matters as much as the milliseconds. A ticket that quietly fell
     * back to the window and PDF path is roughly ten times slower, and until
     * now it looked identical in the log to a fast one.

     *
     * Anything that stops this - no printer injected, a layout that will not
     * render, a roll size we do not know - simply falls through to the window,

     * line the printer has already committed - so the fast path can only ever
     * put the rule somewhere near the name. The window below renders HTML,
     * where `.in.cx { text-decoration: line-through }` has drawn it correctly
     * all along.
     *
     * It costs about a second more per ticket. That is the right trade HERE
     * and nowhere else: a cancellation is rare, it is the ticket a cook must
     * not misread, and every ordinary ticket still takes the 124ms path.

     * dish had to go through the hidden window that renders HTML, where
     * `text-decoration: line-through` has always worked.
     *
     * That was true when it was written, at 01:24. By 12:46 the same day the
     * byte builder was taking a `strikeCancelled` option, and by 13:16
     * escpos-raster-text was drawing the stroke as dots. The capability landed
     * eleven hours after the exclusion and nobody came back to flip the
     * switch, so every cancellation since has paid for a BrowserWindow it no
     * longer needed.
     *
     * Owner, on the paper: "new order print is so so fast. very immediate but
     * cancel order took some time."
     *
     * Measured: the window path costs about a second; the bytes cost 124ms
     * plus the stroke, which is 5,272 bytes against 208 for a plain ticket and
     * under half a second even on a slow serial link.

     * this. when whole order cancelled then send as Order cancelled instead

     * removed or reduced leaves the order open and still says KOT. So the
