/*
 * THE BILL A WAITER ASKED FOR, COMING OUT AT THE COUNTER.
 *
 * Owner: "if mobile give bill then printer out should comes from desktop
 * connected. not from KOT."
 *
 * That is the standard and it is the whole design here. The waiter is at the
 * table when the guest asks for the bill; walking to the counter so somebody
 * else can press a button is the errand a handset exists to remove. So the
 * handset marks the ticket and this - running on the machine that owns the
 * printers - turns the mark into paper.
 *
 * WHY THE PHONE DOES NOT PRINT. It has no printer, it is not on the counter,
 * and a bill is collected by the person holding the drawer. Sending the job
 * from the phone would also mean every handset needing printer drivers, a
 * route to the printer, and the shop's paper settings. The till already has
 * all three.
 *
 * NOT THE KITCHEN'S PRINTER. A KOT and a bill are different documents, not one
 * document in two places: a ticket is departmental and carries only its own
 * lines, a bill is single and carries the totals, the tax and the shop header.
 * printer-targets.js has modelled that split from the start - a LIST of
 * printerNames for KOT, one printerName for the receipt - and this rides it.
 *
 * WHICH PRINTER, WITHOUT ASKING ANYBODY. The bill goes to the same printer a
 * receipt already goes to. That needs no new setting and no new screen: a shop
 * that can print a receipt can print a bill, and a shop that cannot has a
 * problem this feature did not cause and cannot fix. An explicit override can
 * be added the day somebody actually wants the bill somewhere else.
 *
 * POLLED, NOT PUSHED. Kitchen tickets get an event because a ticket is wanted
 * the second it is saved. A bill is wanted by the time the waiter has walked to
 * the counter, so a short poll is enough and is one less moving part. The real
 * reason it is a poll at all is the same reason the KOT path keeps one: a till
 * that was switched off, asleep or mid-update catches up when it comes back
 * instead of losing the bill.
