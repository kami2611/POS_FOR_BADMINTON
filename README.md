# Posnic

**Free open source POS and billing software with public source, local checkout
and online/offline workflows.**

An offline-first POS for retail shops and restaurants. The primary API and
database run on the shop computer or on a server you control; electronic
payments, optional cloud services, downloads and integrations can still need a
network.

Posnic's own source is AGPL-3.0-only. Release packages also bundle separately
licensed components, including MongoDB Community Server under SSPL-1.0. Review
the [package notices](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md) and
[reproduced package evidence](https://www.posnic.com/assets/posnic-package-license-evidence.json)
before making a package-level licence statement.

## Posnic in use

![A completed cash sale in Posnic v1.3.0](docs/images/offline-sale-v1-3-0.png)

This synthetic cash sale was completed and reopened during the bounded
[offline workflow verification](https://www.posnic.com/posnic-facts). The published
test notes state what was blocked, what passed and what the result does not
prove.

## Why Posnic

Posnic runs its primary database and API on the till itself. In a bounded
v1.3.0 Windows test, one synthetic cash sale completed and reopened while
external hosts were blocked inside Electron. This does not prove an
operating-system-wide outage, complete shift, payment-terminal path, power-loss
recovery or every workflow. Review the
[versioned evidence and limitations](https://www.posnic.com/posnic-facts).

- **Free local edition.** The v1.3.0 desktop packages have no trial clock and
  have a zero software price. Posnic's own source is AGPL-3.0-only; packaged
  dependencies retain their own licences. Hardware, support, backups, optional
  services and downtime can still create operating costs.
- **Local data path.** The local edition needs no Posnic account, and its
  published privacy policy says it sends no analytics or telemetry to Posnic.
  See [PRIVACY.md](docs/PRIVACY.md).
- **Posnic source under AGPL-3.0-only.** Read it, change it, self-host it and
  fork it under the licence terms. Review each bundled component separately.

### Using Posnic in a real business or pilot?

Share a bounded
[deployment evidence report](https://github.com/Posnic/POS/issues/new?template=deployment_evidence.yml),
including failures, workarounds, or why a trial stopped. The form records the
exact version, relationship, observation window, workflows and limitations while
letting you refuse marketing reuse. Read the
[adoption evidence policy](docs/ADOPTION_EVIDENCE.md) before posting private or
production information.

### Reviewing Posnic independently?

Use the public [review brief](https://www.posnic.com/assets/posnic-independent-review-brief.txt)
and [24-control protocol](https://www.posnic.com/assets/posnic-independent-review-protocol.csv)
with the exact release, package filename and SHA-256 you tested. Review access
does not require payment, positive coverage, a backlink or advance approval.
Publish failures, conflicts and untested areas beside successful results. An
independent evaluator can submit a bounded public result through the
[deployment evidence form](https://github.com/Posnic/POS/issues/new?template=deployment_evidence.yml)
without granting marketing reuse.

## Install

Posnic installs two ways, both free and both the same AGPL-3.0 software.
**Most shops want the desktop app.**

| | **Desktop** | **Your own server** |
|---|---|---|
| Install | Download and run | One command on Ubuntu |
| Used from | That computer | A browser on any till, tablet or phone on the network |
| Data lives | That computer | Your server |
| Needs internet | No | No — your own network is enough |
| Somebody maintains it | No | **You** — updates, backups, certificate |
| Sync between shops | Posnic Cloud | Posnic Cloud |

A server is not a better desktop; it is a machine somebody has to look after. If
one person rings up sales on one computer, the desktop app is the right answer
and always will be.

For a fuller comparison of local desktop, self-hosted network, and managed
operation, read the [Offline POS vs Online/Offline POS deployment
guide](https://posnic.github.io/offline-vs-online-pos.html).

### Desktop

Download the package for your platform from
**[the latest release](https://github.com/Posnic/POS/releases/latest)**, run it,
and follow the wizard. Current v1.6.2 packages include MongoDB Community Server
under its separate SSPL-1.0 licence, so no separate database install is needed
for the bundled setup. See [third-party notices](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md).

Verify your download against `SHA256SUMS.txt`. For releases that provide an
artifact-bound SBOM and provenance, follow the [release verification guide](docs/VERIFY_RELEASE.md).

> Current v1.6.2 Windows installers are signed and timestamped, and macOS
> packages are signed and notarized. If the operating system reports an unknown
> publisher, stop and verify the package against the official release before
> running it. **Linux**: make the `.AppImage` executable, or install the `.deb`.

First launch takes a few minutes while it sets up its database. After that,
seconds. Full walkthrough in the **[user guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md)**.

### Your own server

Ubuntu 24.04, 2 GB of memory, 8 GB of disk. A 2 GB virtual machine from any
provider runs a single shop comfortably.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Posnic/POS/main/scripts/install-server.sh -o install-server.sh
less install-server.sh          # read it first - you are about to run it as root
sudo bash install-server.sh
```

It installs Node.js 22, MongoDB 8 and Posnic into `/opt/posnic`, generates that
machine's own secrets, and runs it under systemd so it survives a reboot. When
it finishes it prints the address to open. Re-running it updates Posnic and
leaves your secrets and your data alone.

Three things it cannot do for you, none of them optional on a shop taking real
money: **get a certificate** (without one, passwords cross the network in the
clear), **keep port 27017 off the internet**, and **restore a backup once** to
prove it is a backup rather than a file.

**Self-hosting does not include sync between tills or branches.** That is
[Posnic Cloud](https://www.posnic.com/pricing). A self-hosted Posnic is one
database several people use at once — which is what most single-shop setups
actually want — not several databases kept in step.

Full guide, including installing by hand on other systems:
**[docs/SELF_HOSTING.md](docs/SELF_HOSTING.md)**.

## Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Posnic/POS.git
cd POS
npm install
npm --prefix api install
npm start
```

Needs Node 22.12+. The build tooling fetches MongoDB Community Server 7.0.14 and
the desktop process chooses a port derived from the app name to reduce collision
risk. Review [the architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and package licences before
building or distributing an artifact.

```bash
npm run build          # Windows installer
npm run build:mac
npm run build:linux
```

New contributors should start with the
**[contributor quickstart](docs/CONTRIBUTOR_QUICKSTART.md)**. See the
**[developer guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)** for deeper tests, linting and
conventions.

## Editions

The desktop packages have a zero software price and no trial clock. Posnic's own
source is AGPL-3.0-only, while bundled components keep their separate licences.
**Posnic Cloud** is a paid service for shops that want more than one till.

| | Posnic (this repo) | Posnic Cloud |
|---|---|---|
| Selected local workflows and local operational records | ✅ | ✅ |
| Local database and backups | ✅ | ✅ |
| Documented printer, scanner, drawer and scale paths | ✅ | ✅ |
| GST invoicing and reports | ✅ | ✅ |
| Runs on your own server, used from a browser | ✅ | ✅ |
| Sync across tills and branches | | ✅ |
| Off-site backups, remote dashboard | | ✅ |
| Installer under your own brand | | ✅ |

Both ways of running Posnic — [desktop and your own server](#install) — sit in
the left column. Neither is a trial and neither expires.

**We do not move features from the left column to the right.** What is free
today stays free. Cloud has to earn its price by being useful, not by making
the free edition worse. This is written down in [GOVERNANCE.md](docs/GOVERNANCE.md).

## Contributing

Bug reports, fixes, translations, hardware quirks from real shops, documentation
— all welcome, and none of it requires permission to start. The
[contributor quickstart](docs/CONTRIBUTOR_QUICKSTART.md) gives the local setup,
test commands and public feature-ticket map.

Good places to begin are listed in the
[developer guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#good-first-issues): 19 known-failing tests,
21 real latent bugs the linter found, and two very large files that want
splitting.

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) first. Security issues go to
[SECURITY.md](.github/SECURITY.md), privately — never a public issue.

## Buy the team a chai ☕

Posnic is built by a small team in Tamil Nadu, India, and given away because a
shop should not have to rent its own till. If it saves you money, sending a
little back is what keeps the next release coming.

| | |
|---|---|
| ☕ **[Buy us a chai](https://github.com/sponsors/Posnic)** | one-off or monthly, from a dollar up |
| ☁️ **[Posnic Cloud](https://www.posnic.com/pricing)** | sync, off-site backups, remote dashboards — the paid service that funds this one |
| 🏢 **Commercial licence** | keep your modifications private — **info@posnic.com** |

Sponsors are named in releases unless they would rather not be.

Paid setup, migration from an existing till, hardware selection, custom
reporting and white-labelled installers are all available. The software stays
free either way — see [GOVERNANCE.md](docs/GOVERNANCE.md) for what we have promised
never to move behind a paywall.

## Source and package licences

Posnic's own source is [GNU AGPL-3.0-only](LICENSE). Use, change, self-host and
redistribute that source under the licence terms. Release packages also include
separately licensed components; read [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md)
and the licence material shipped with the exact artifact. This summary is not
legal advice.

The **Posnic name and logo are trademarks** and are not covered by the AGPL —
see [GOVERNANCE.md § Trademark](docs/GOVERNANCE.md#trademark-and-reserved-rights).

Companies needing to keep modifications private can buy a commercial licence:
**info@posnic.com**. Such a licence covers the code Posnic owns. Contributors
keep the copyright in what they write and there is no CLA, so community code can
only be relicensed with its author's agreement — a deliberate limit on our own
power, set out in [GOVERNANCE.md § Contributor
copyright](docs/GOVERNANCE.md#contributor-copyright).
