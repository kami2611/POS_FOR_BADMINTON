/*
 * One version, written everywhere it is stated.

 * package.json is not the only file that names the release. codemeta.json
 * states it twice (version and softwareVersion), CITATION.cff states it again,
 * and the generated OpenAPI spec carries it in info.version. Three separate
 * tests assert they all agree, and
 * CI regenerates the docs and fails on any diff.
 *
 * The first real run of `release:ship` bumped package.json alone and CI
 * refused the release a minute later - correctly, and after the tag had
 * already been pushed. Bumping is therefore not an edit to one file; it is
 * this script, and release-ship.js calls it before committing.
 *
 *   node scripts/sync-version.js            # sync every file to package.json
 *   node scripts/sync-version.js --check    # fail if any of them disagree
