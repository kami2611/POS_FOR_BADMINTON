/*
 * Every package a source file requires must be declared by the package that
 * owns that file.
 *
 * The API had six that were not. `winston` and `winston-daily-rotate-file` in
 * utils/logger.js, `node-cron` in the crons controller, `express-mongo-sanitize`
 * and `xss-clean` in middleware/security.js, and `aws-sdk` - AWS SDK v2, which
 * reached end of life - in three S3 code paths, while package.json declares the
 * v3 client. None of those files can be required at all; they throw
 * "Cannot find module" on the first line. They survive because nothing mounts
 * them and their tests mock the imports away.
 *
 * `mongodb` was the opposite and more dangerous: 56 files required it and
 * nothing declared it. It resolved anyway because mongoose hoists it, which
 * means a mongoose upgrade could have swapped the driver underneath the API
 * without a single line of this repo changing.
 *
 * This is a static check on purpose. Actually requiring these modules would
 * work - and would also open database connections, because some constructors
 * do that on import. Reading the require calls costs nothing and has no side
 * effects.
