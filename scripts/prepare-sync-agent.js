 * Optional build step: bundle the POSNIC Cloud sync agent into the installer.
 *
 * The agent is proprietary and lives in the private Cloud repo. If a sibling
 * checkout exists (../Cloud/apps/sync-agent, or SYNC_AGENT_DIR env), it is
 * copied (with production node_modules) into builds/sync-agent so
 * electron-builder ships it under resources/sync-agent.
 *
 * Open-source builds: the folder is absent → an empty placeholder is created
 * and the app simply runs without cloud sync.

   * NO node_modules IS THE NORMAL CASE, not a mistake, and the old warning

   *
   * The agent declares bson, dotenv and mongodb, and ships with none of them.
   * It works because it is spawned from the Electron main process, which
   * inherits NODE_PATH pointing at the API's own node_modules - see
   * src/server.js, where that is set up for the in-process API. The agent
   * needs the same three packages the API already carries, so a second copy
   * would be dead weight in the installer.
   *
   * The old text told whoever saw it to run npm install in the Cloud agent,
   * which would have made every installer larger to fix nothing. A warning
   * that fires on every correct build is a warning people learn to scroll
   * past, and then the real one goes past too.
   *
   * Said out loud rather than deleted, because the coupling is invisible from
   * here and somebody should know it exists. tests/the-sync-agent-finds-its-
   * modules.test.js pins it.
