/*
 * EVERY CHECK CI RUNS, ON THIS MACHINE.
 *
 * Owner: "better run all ci stuff inside commit. github bill came around 200
 * usd" and then, on scope: "deploy stuff is okay. other check only i said."
 *
 * So this is the CHECK half of .github/workflows/ci.yml and nothing else. The
 * deploys, the releases and the packaging of an installer stay where they are:
 * they need secrets, signing keys and three operating systems, and none of
 * that belongs on a laptop.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS FOR. Run before pushing - `npm run check` by hand, or let the
 * pre-push hook run it - and a push stops failing for something that was
 * visible in ninety seconds. Whether the minutes it saves are billed or not,
 * the round trip through a queue to be told about a lint error is the slowest
 * way to learn anything.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT. A replacement for the checks on the pull request. Those are
 * the gate on merging and they run on a clean machine with a clean checkout,
 * which is the only way to catch "it works here" - a file never committed, a
 * dependency installed globally, a stale build left in a folder. This runs the
 * same commands against the tree in front of you, which is a different and
 * weaker question, deliberately.
 *
 * SPEED. The slow suites are skipped unless asked for, because a check nobody
 * waits for is a check nobody runs:
 *
 *   npm run check           the fast ones - about a minute
 *   npm run check -- --all  everything, including the database suite
 *   npm run check -- --list what would run, and nothing else
