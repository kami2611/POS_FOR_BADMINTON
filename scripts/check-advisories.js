/*
 * Fail on a new production advisory; stay quiet about ones already judged.
 *
 * `npm audit` on this project reports two moderate advisories that cannot be
 * reached from any code path here. Left alone, the output is permanently
 * non-zero - and a check that is always red is a check nobody reads, which is
 * how the advisory that does matter gets missed. Ignoring the command entirely
 * has the same effect, more honestly.
 *
 * So each accepted advisory is written down with the reasoning that made it
 * acceptable, and anything not on that list fails the build. The list is short
 * on purpose: an exception costs a paragraph explaining why, which is the right
 * price. If an entry ever stops being true - a dependency starts calling the
 * vulnerable path - it should be deleted rather than amended.
 *
 * Development-only advisories are not covered. They belong to build tooling
 * that never reaches a shop, and mixing them in here would bury the ones that
 * do. Run `npm audit` without --omit=dev to see those.
