 * The MongoDB server has to be here before an installer can be built.

 * It used to be committed, so it was always present and nobody had to think
 * about it. It is not committed any more: it is 60MB of somebody else's software
 * under the SSPL, and keeping it in git made every clone 130MB and made this
 * repository a redistributor of a licence that is not its own.
 * download-mongodb.bat fetches the same files from MongoDB's own servers.
 *
 * Without this check the build would still succeed. electron-builder treats a
 * missing extraResources path as nothing to copy, so the installer would be
 * produced, would install, and would fail on a shop's counter the first time it
 * tried to start its database - which is the worst possible place to discover
 * it. Failing here, before anything is built, costs one command.

 * This check runs first in the prebuild chain, before prepare:bundle - and
 * prepare:bundle is what runs prepare:vc-runtime, which copies the three
 * VC runtime DLLs off the machine. So on a fresh clone this listed all four as
 * missing and said "fetch them with download-mongodb.bat", which is wrong
 * twice: three of them are supplied by the build a moment later, and that
 * script does not contain them anyway - MongoDB's own archive ships
 * vc_redist.x64.exe, an installer, not the DLLs.
 *
 * Somebody following that advice downloads 600MB, sees the same four names
 * again, and has no way to tell that three of them were never the problem.
 *
 * So this fails only on what nobody else will supply. The DLLs still have to
 * be there in the finished package, and they are guaranteed by
 * bundle-vc-runtime.js, which exits non-zero if it cannot find them - a check
 * that runs AFTER the step that produces them, which is the only place a check
 * for them means anything.
