 * Get back into a shop when nothing else can.
 *
 *   node scripts/recover-access.js                     list who can sign in
 *   node scripts/recover-access.js <email> <password>   set one password
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS.
 *
 * Every other way back in goes through us. The console needs our staff, the
 * reset email needs our mail account, and support needs to be awake. A shop
 * running Posnic on its own server, or a till on a network with no way out,
 * has none of those - and when its owner is locked out, the shop stops selling.
 *
 * Until now the only remedy was a database edit performed by somebody who knew
 * that this application hashes bcrypt over BASE64 of the password rather than
 * over the password. Get that wrong and sign-in appears to work - the login
 * falls back to a plain hash - while manager approvals, which only ever compare
 * the base64 form, silently stop accepting it. That knowledge lived in one
 * person's head. This makes it a documented, audited command instead.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT.
 *
 * Not a privilege escalation. Anybody who can run this can already read the
 * database it writes to - they own the machine. The security boundary is the
 * operating system's, and it always was. What changes is that recovery is now
 * WRITTEN DOWN and LEAVES A RECORD, rather than being a secret technique.
 *
 * It refuses to touch a shop it cannot reach locally, and every use is written
 * to the shop's own audit_log with the operating-system account that ran it -
 * so the business can see it happened, which is the whole point.
