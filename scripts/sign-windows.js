/*
 * Authenticode signing for the Windows build, against a Certum card.
 *
 * WHY A CUSTOM HOOK RATHER THAN JUST `certificateSubjectName`
 *
 * electron-builder can invoke signtool by itself, and for a certificate held in
 * a .pfx that is the right answer. A cryptographic card is different in three
 * ways, and each of them costs a build if it is not handled here:
 *
 *   1. THE CARD IS NOT ALWAYS THERE. Releases build on GitHub-hosted
 *      windows-latest runners, which have no reader and never will. With a
 *      certificate named in package.json the build FAILS there; with signing
 *      driven by an environment variable it simply produces the unsigned
 *      installer it produces today. Turning signing on must not turn CI off.
 *
 *   2. TIMESTAMPING IS A NETWORK CALL, and public TSAs flake. An unretried
 *      failure throws away a ten-minute build for a hiccup that clears in two
 *      seconds. It is retried here.
 *
 *   3. THE CARD ASKS FOR A PIN, once per file, and electron-builder signs
 *      several. Nothing can suppress that from this side, but naming the file
 *      being signed at least tells you which prompt you are answering.
 *
 * TIMESTAMPING IS NOT OPTIONAL. A signature without one stops validating the
 * day the certificate expires - so every installer already in a shop's hands
 * would start warning. With one, it stays valid after expiry, which is the
 * whole point of signing a thing people keep.
 *
 * TURNING IT ON
 *
 *   POSNIC_SIGN_SHA1=<thumbprint>     preferred - unambiguous
 *   POSNIC_SIGN_SUBJECT=<CN>          alternative, if two certs share a subject
 *                                     this picks the wrong one silently
 *
 * Neither set: signing is skipped, loudly enough to notice, and the build
 * succeeds. That is the CI case and the "I forgot the card" case, which look
 * identical from here and want the same answer.
