/*
 * Photographs for the demo products, from Wikimedia Commons.
 *
 * WHY COMMONS
 *
 * The demo products are generic goods - "Cappuccino", "Claw Hammer 500g",
 * "Whole Wheat Bread" - not branded packages. So the question is not "where do
 * we find a picture of THIS product" but "where do we find a freely licensed
 * photograph of this KIND of thing", and Commons is the largest such library
 * there is.
 *
 * It also settles the licensing, which is the part that cannot be hand-waved:
 * these images ship inside a commercial product, to every customer, in every
 * country. Photographs lifted from a search engine are somebody's copyright
 * whatever the intention. This script accepts public-domain and CC licences
 * only, refuses everything else, and records the attribution for every file it
 * keeps - so the credit exists whether or not anyone remembers to write it.
 *
 * WHAT IT WILL NOT DO
 *
 * It will not invent a match. A search that returns nothing acceptable leaves
 * that product without an image, and the till already has a good answer for
 * that: PosnicPro.autoTile gives it a coloured tile from its own name. A wrong
 * photograph is worse than no photograph - a picture of the wrong thing on a
 * sale grid is read as fact and slows the person down.
 *
 *   node scripts/fetch-demo-images.js            # fetch what is missing
 *   node scripts/fetch-demo-images.js --dry-run  # search only, write nothing
 *   node scripts/fetch-demo-images.js --only=cafe

 * second guess is rarely better than the first. But some of these failed for a
 * reason a person can fix in one word rather than one the search can never get
 * past:

 *   "Filter Coffee"  returns coffee FILTERS, the equipment
 *   "Grilled Fish"   returns raw fish on ice at a market
 *   "Steamed Rice"   returns a shop counter that happens to sell it
