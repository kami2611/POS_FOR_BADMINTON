/*
 * Which code signing certificate should the build use?
 *
 * The Certum certificate lives on a cryptographic card. It only becomes visible
 * to Windows - and therefore to signtool - once the card is inserted and
 * proCertum CardManager has registered it into the certificate store. Until
 * then the store holds nothing useful, and a build configured to sign fails
 * with an error that says very little.
 *
 * So this answers the two questions worth answering before a release: is the
 * certificate there at all, and what do I set POSNIC_SIGN_SHA1 to.
 *
 * It deliberately shows expiry. A code signing certificate that expires mid-week
 * is a release that silently starts shipping "Unknown publisher" - and because
 * signing is opt-in here, nothing else would complain.

 * happened here, and the cause was two layers down: CardManager reaches the
 * card through Certum's own CSP, but WINDOWS only publishes a smart card's
 * certificates once a MINIDRIVER claims that card model. With no match Windows
 * calls it "Unknown Smart Card", publishes nothing, and signtool sees an empty
 * store while the card sits there working perfectly in another application.
 *
 * So this says which of the three it actually is: no card, a card no driver
 * claims, or a card that is claimed but whose certificate is not registered.
