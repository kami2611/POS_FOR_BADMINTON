/*
 * Give existing shops the explicit feature settings that new shops now get -
 * without switching off anything a shop is actually using.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR
 *
 * "why these many activated already. this is not i wanted."
 *
 * A module is read as ON unless a branch document explicitly says false
 * (PosnicPro.js: `s[k] !== false`). A shop that has never touched Settings has
 * no module_* keys at all, so every feature reads as enabled. Nobody chose
 * that; it is what "absent" happens to mean. A new shop is now created with
 * four features on and the rest off, but defaults only apply at creation, so
 * every shop that already exists still shows the full menu.
 *
 * WHY THE CONVENTION IS NOT SIMPLY FLIPPED
 *
 * Because absent-means-on is load-bearing for every shop already running. A
 * shop that has been taking credit sales for a year has no module_credit_enable
 * key either - it never needed one. Change what absent means, deploy, and that
 * shop's Credit menu disappears overnight, its outstanding balances become
 * unreachable, and nothing anywhere reports an error. The data is all still
 * there, which is what makes it so hard to diagnose: it looks like the feature
 * was removed from the product.
 *
 * So this writes EXPLICIT values instead, and decides each one from evidence.
 *
 * THE RULE
 *
 *   in use            -> true    the shop has records for it. Never taken away.
 *   never used, core  -> true    Tax, Quick sale, Themes: the new-shop defaults.
 *   never used, other -> false   off, and one click from on.
 *
 * "In use" is counted from the shop's own data, not from a settings flag,
 * because the settings flag is the thing that is missing. A single record is
 * enough: somebody who wrote one expense is using the cash book, and being
 * wrong in that direction costs a menu entry, while being wrong in the other
 * direction hides their work.
 *
 * REPORTS BEFORE IT TOUCHES ANYTHING. --apply is required to write, and even
 * then it only ever fills in keys that are absent: a shop that has switched
 * something off has decided, and a migration that "corrects" a deliberate
 * setting is worse than the gap it closes.
