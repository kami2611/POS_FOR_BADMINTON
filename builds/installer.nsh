; The file list stays visible - a shop watching an installer that says nothing
; for two minutes assumes it has hung.
;
; Colours are ink on white rather than the green-on-black this used to be. That
; scheme reads as a terminal from 1998, and the setup wizard is the first thing
; anyone sees of this product. Foreground first, then background.

; Wording on the welcome and finish pages. The defaults are electron-builder's
; generic strings; a shop installing a till reads these once, and they are the
; only chance to say what this is and what to expect.
;
; $\r$\n is NSIS's line break. It has to reach makensis as those characters -
; writing a real carriage return here ends the string early and the build fails
; with "unterminated string".
; THE SAME SCRIPT IS COMPILED TWICE: once for the installer, once for the
; uninstaller (electron-builder defines BUILD_UNINSTALLER for the second
; pass). These page texts used to be defined once, so the uninstaller's
; finish page announced "Posnic is installed" at the end of an uninstall.
; Owner: "i saw message like pos installed on the end while uninstalled."
