/*
 * The shop's public menu.
 *
 * Read-only, by design and not by omission. There is no cart here, no prices
 * that become a total, and nothing that starts an order - that is what
 * /order is for. A menu is the thing a customer reads at the table, outside
 * the window, or in a message a friend sent them, and it should do that one
 * job faster and more clearly than the paper it replaced.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES A MENU GOOD, and what each of those costs here:
 *
 *   Scannable      two-line descriptions on the card, the whole thing in the
 *                  detail sheet. A page where every dish is a paragraph
 *                  cannot be read at a table.
 *   Navigable      category chips that travel with you and light up as you
 *                  scroll. Scrolling back to the top to change section is what
 *                  makes a digital menu worse than paper.
 *   Searchable     one box, instant, over names and descriptions, with a
 *                  count read out to a screen reader.
 *   Honest         a dish that is off tonight is shown and marked, not hidden.
 *                  A menu with holes reads as a kitchen that has run out.
 *   Marked         the veg dot, which Indian menus carry by law and customers
 *                  look for before they read the name.
 *
 * Vanilla, and small. A menu is a list; a framework to render one is weight a
 * phone on a bad connection pays for nothing.
