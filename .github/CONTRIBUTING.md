# Contributing to Posnic

Thanks for helping make Posnic better! Contributions of every kind are
welcome: bug reports, fixes, features, translations, docs, and reports of
hardware quirks from real shops.

## Getting started

If this is your first Posnic contribution, start with the
[contributor quickstart](../docs/CONTRIBUTOR_QUICKSTART.md). It has the local
setup commands, common test commands, and task map for translations, GST,
e-invoicing, AI helper work, integrations and hardware evidence.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Posnic/POS.git
cd POS
npm install
npm --prefix api install
npm start
```

You do **not** need to install MongoDB. Posnic bundles its own and picks a port
derived from the application name, so it never collides with a database you
already run. The first launch takes a few minutes while it unpacks.

- [Contributor quickstart](../docs/CONTRIBUTOR_QUICKSTART.md) — first setup,
  task map and test matrix
- [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](../docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) — full developer guide: tests,
  linting, conventions, and what not to rename
- [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — how the pieces fit together
- [docs/API.md](../docs/API.md) — REST reference
- [docs/BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md](../docs/BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md) — installer builds

## How to contribute

1. **Open an issue first** for anything non-trivial — a bug report or a short
   proposal for a feature. It avoids wasted work on both sides.
2. Pick a task from the
   [contributor roadmap](https://github.com/Posnic/POS/issues/35) or the
   [`good first issue`](https://github.com/Posnic/POS/labels/good%20first%20issue)
   label.
3. Read the issue acceptance criteria and choose one small checkbox or PR slice.
   If the issue does not yet define "done", start by proposing that checklist.
4. Fork, create a branch (`fix/receipt-rounding`, `feat/tamil-translation`).
5. Keep pull requests focused — one change per PR.
6. Match the style of the surrounding code; avoid drive-by reformatting.
7. Run the tests: `cd api && npm test` (7,744 unit tests, about a minute), plus
   `npm test` at the repo root for the desktop side (294 more). Both should pass on a
   clean checkout — if they do not, that is worth an issue on its own.

   `npm test` skips twelve quarantined suites listed in
   `api/jest.known-failures.js`; `npm run test:known-failures` shows exactly
   where those stand, and they are good first issues.

Nineteen unit tests fail on a clean checkout. That is known drift, tracked as
good first issues — not something you broke. If your branch makes it twenty,
that one is yours.

**Do not rename a persisted field or collection in a pull request.** Those names
travel over the sync wire to desktop installations that cannot be force-updated,
so renaming them needs a versioned migration. See
[docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](../docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#what-not-to-rename).

## What happens to your pull request

So you know what you are waiting for.

1. **CI runs** — unit tests, the desktop tests, lint, the packaging check and
   the API docs check. All of them gate: if CI is red, the pull request waits.
2. **A maintainer reads it.** Usually within a week. The project is small; see
   [GOVERNANCE.md](../docs/GOVERNANCE.md).
3. **You may get comments.** Comments are not rejection. A pull request with
   twenty comments is one someone is taking seriously.
4. **It merges**, or it does not — and if it does not, the reason is written in
   the thread. A silent close is a failure on our part; say so if it happens.

### What gets merged quickly

- A failing test that now passes
- A fix with a test proving it
- Documentation, including fixes to this file
- Small, focused changes with a clear description

### What takes longer, and why

- **Changes to sync**, the build pipeline, or white-label behaviour. These reach
  machines that cannot be force-updated; getting them wrong breaks shops that
  cannot roll back.
- **New dependencies.** Every one is weight in an installer downloaded over a
  slow connection, and something to keep patched for years.
- **Large refactors with no prior issue.** Not unwelcome — but talk first, so
  nobody spends a weekend on a direction we will not take.
- **Anything requiring an internet connection** in the local edition. It must
  work fully offline. That belongs in Cloud.

### If nobody replies

Comment on the thread after a week. That is not nagging, it is a useful nudge —
notifications get missed. If it is still quiet after two weeks, say so in
[Discussions](https://github.com/Posnic/POS/discussions).

## Reporting bugs and requesting features

Both live in [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md), including what a report needs to be
actionable, how issues are labelled and prioritised, and what happens to a
feature request after you file it.

Two things worth repeating here:

- **Security problems are never a public issue.** See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- **Feature requests should describe the problem, not the solution.** What you
  are trying to do tells us more than the button you imagined, and often has a
  better answer.

## Contribute evidence without changing code

Reproducible observations are useful contributions. They help turn a broad
feature statement into a versioned result with an exact input, environment and
limitation.

- If you are reviewing Posnic independently, start with the public
  [review brief](https://www.posnic.com/assets/posnic-independent-review-brief.txt)
  and [24-control protocol](https://www.posnic.com/assets/posnic-independent-review-protocol.csv).
  Review access does not require payment, positive coverage, a backlink or
  advance approval. Publish failures, conflicts and untested areas as well as
  successful results.
- Run the public
  [vendor-neutral POS acceptance fixture](https://www.posnic.com/open-source-pos-benchmark#vendor-neutral-pos-acceptance-fixture)
  and submit the structured
  [acceptance result form](https://github.com/Posnic/POS/issues/new?template=pos_acceptance_run.yml).
- Test an exact printer, scanner, cash drawer, scale or display against the
  [hardware matrix](../docs/HARDWARE_MATRIX.md), then submit the structured
  [hardware evidence form](https://github.com/Posnic/POS/issues/new?template=hardware_evidence.yml).
- If you operate, piloted, installed, evaluated or stopped using Posnic, read
  the [adoption evidence policy](../docs/ADOPTION_EVIDENCE.md) and submit a
  structured
  [deployment evidence report](https://github.com/Posnic/POS/issues/new?template=deployment_evidence.yml).
  Failures, workarounds and reasons not to adopt are useful evidence.
- Read [ROADMAP.md](../docs/ROADMAP.md) for the current evidence gaps and the boundary
  between released, reproduced, in-validation and planned work.

An evidence issue is public and is not a certification or testimonial. Use
fictional transactions and remove customer data, payment data, credentials,
tokens, production logs and database files before attaching anything. Security
problems still go through [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), never a public issue.

## Human attribution only

Posnic credits people, not tools. Do not list an AI assistant, agent, model,
bot, automation, or coding tool as an author, contributor, co-author, reviewer,
maintainer, credit, or DCO sign-off. Commit trailers and project metadata must
name the human contributor only.

Remove assistant signature footers before committing. If a maintainer asks how
a change was produced, describe tool use in the pull-request body as context,
not contributor credit.

Run `npm run check:attribution` before opening a pull request. The same rule runs
in CI and in the local Git hooks after installing them with:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

## Sign your commits (DCO)

We use the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/).
Sign each commit with `git commit -s`, which adds:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>
```

By signing off you certify that the work is yours to submit and that you have
the right to contribute it on the terms below.

## Sign the CLA, once

Alongside the DCO we ask for a one-line signature on the
[Contributor Licence Agreement](CLA.md). A bot asks for it on your first pull
request and remembers it afterwards.

**You keep the copyright in your work.** It is a licence, not an assignment, and
you stay free to use and publish your own contribution anywhere else. What it
adds beyond the DCO is the right to *sublicense*: Posnic publishes this project
under AGPL-3.0 and intends to keep doing so, and the same right lets us ship a
branded, signed and supported build commercially. That paid edition is what pays
for the work on the open one. Without the sublicense right we could not offer it
at all.

Your contribution stays available to everyone under AGPL-3.0 regardless. Nothing
in the agreement lets us take that away.

## What makes a great bug report

- Posnic version (Help → About) and your operating system
- Steps to reproduce, what you expected, what happened
- The log file:
  - Windows `%APPDATA%\posnic\app.log`
  - macOS `~/Library/Application Support/posnic/app.log`
  - Linux `~/.config/posnic/app.log`
- For hardware issues: printer/scanner model and connection type

## Scope notes

- The **local edition must always work fully offline** — features that require
  internet access will not be accepted into the core.
- Cloud-side services (sync gateway, subscriptions) are proprietary and live in
  a private repository; the open app only ever talks to them through the
  documented sync agent interface.
